<p>When that April with his showers sweet</p>
<p>The drought of March has pierced root deep,</p>
<p>And bathed each vein with liquor of such power</p>
<p>That engendered from it is the flower,</p>
<p>When Zephyrus too with his gentle strife,</p>
<p>To every field and wood, has brought new life</p>
<p>In tender shoots, and the youthful sun</p>
<p>Half his course through the Ram has run,</p>
<p>And little birds are making melody,</p>
<p>Who all the night with open eye do sleep –</p>
<p>Nature their hearts in every way so pricks –</p>
<p>Then people long to go on pilgrimage,</p>
<p>And palmers who seek out foreign strands,</p>
<p>To far-off shrines, renowned in sundry lands;</p>
<p>And specially, from every shire’s end</p>
<p>Of England, down to Canterbury they wend,</p>
<p>The holy blissful martyr there to seek,</p>
<p>Who had aided them when they were sick.</p>
<p>It befell that in that season on a day,</p>
<p>In Southwark at The Tabard as I lay,</p>
<p>Ready to set out on my pilgrimage</p>
<p>To Canterbury with pious courage,</p>
<p>There came at night to that hostelry</p>
<p>Quite nine and twenty in a company</p>
<p>Of sundry folk who had chanced to fall</p>
<p>Into a fellowship, and pilgrims all,</p>
<p>That towards Canterbury meant to ride.</p>
<p>The chambers and the stables were full wide,</p>
<p>And we housed at our ease, and of the best;</p>
<p>And shortly, when the sun had gone to rest,</p>
<p>I had such speech with each and everyone,</p>
<p>That of their fellowship I soon made one,</p>
<p>Agreeing I would make an early rise,</p>
<p>To take our way there, as I now advise.</p>

<p>Nonetheless while I have time and space,</p>
<p>Before a step more of my tale I pace,</p>
<p>It seems to me in full accord with reason,</p>
<p>To tell you everything of their condition,</p>
<p>Of each of them, as they appeared to me,</p>
<p>And who they were, and of what degree,</p>
<p>And what apparel they were travelling in;</p>
<p>And with a knight then I will first begin.</p>
<p>There was a KNIGHT and he a worthy man,</p>
<p>That from the day on which he first began,</p>
<p>To ride abroad, had followed chivalry,</p>
<p>Truth, honour, courtesy and charity.</p>
<p>He had fought nobly in his lord’s war,</p>
<p>And ridden to the fray, and no man more,</p>
<p>As much in Christendom as heathen place,</p>
<p>And ever honoured for his worth and grace.</p>
<p>When we took Alexandria was there;</p>
<p>Often at table held the place of honour,</p>
<p>Above all other nations too in Prussia;</p>
<p>Campaigned in Lithuania and Russia,</p>
<p>No Christian man of his rank more often.</p>
<p>At the siege of Algeciras had he been,</p>
<p>In Granada, and on Moroccan shore;</p>
<p>He was at Ayash and Antalya</p>
<p>When taken, and many times had been</p>
<p>In action on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Of mortal battles he had seen fifteen,</p>
<p>And fought for the faith at Tramissene</p>
<p>Thrice in the lists and always slain his foe.</p>
<p>This same worthy knight had been also</p>
<p>With the Emir of Balat once, at work</p>
<p>With him against some other heathen Turk;</p>
<p>Won him a reputation highly prized,</p>
<p>And though he was valiant, he was wise,</p>
<p>And in his manner modest as a maid.</p>
<p>And never a discourtesy he said</p>
<p>In all his life to those who met his sight;</p>
<p>He was a very perfect gentle knight.</p>
<p>But to tell of his equipment, his array,</p>
<p>His horses fine, he wore no colours gay</p>
<p>Sported a tunic, padded fustian</p>
<p>On which his coat of mail left many a stain;</p>
<p>For he was scarcely back from his voyage,</p>
<p>And going now to make his pilgrimage.</p>
<p>With him there was his son, a young SQUIRE,</p>
<p>Lover and lively bachelor entire</p>
<p>With locks as crisp as from a curling-press;</p>
<p>Of twenty years of age he was, I guess.</p>
<p>Of his stature, he was of middle height,</p>
<p>Wonderfully agile, powerful in a fight.</p>
<p>And had served a while in the cavalry,</p>
<p>In Flanders, in Artois and Picardy,</p>
<p>And done so well, and in so short a space,</p>
<p>He hoped for favour from his lady’s grace.</p>
<p>Like to a meadow he was embroidered,</p>
<p>One full of fresh flowers white and red.</p>
<p>Singing he was, or playing flute all day;</p>
<p>He was as fresh as is the month of May.</p>
<p>Short was his gown, with sleeves both long and wide;</p>
<p>He knew how to sit a horse, and could ride.</p>
<p>He could make songs, and compose aright,</p>
<p>Joust and dance, and draw things well and write.</p>
<p>He loved so hotly night through without fail</p>
<p>He slept no more than does the nightingale.</p>
<p>Courteous he was, humble, attentive, able,</p>
<p>And carved for his father at the table.</p>
<p>A YEOMAN had he (servants did forgo</p>
<p>Other than this, and chose to travel so),</p>
<p>One who was clad in coat and hood of green.</p>
<p>A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen</p>
<p>Sheathed in his belt he bore right properly –</p>
<p>Well could he dress his gear, yeomanly;</p>
<p>His arrows never drooped with feathers low –</p>
<p>And in his hand he bore a mighty bow.</p>
<p>Cropped hair he had, and a nut-brown visage;</p>
<p>Of woodcraft he well knew all the usage.</p>
<p>On his arm an archer’s brace he wore,</p>
<p>And by his side a buckler and a sword,</p>
<p>And at the other side a jaunty dagger</p>
<p>Ornamented, and sharp as any spear;</p>
<p>On his breast St Christopher did gleam.</p>
<p>He bore a horn, the baldric was of green.</p>
<p>He truly was a forester, I guess.</p>
<p>There was also a nun, a PRIORESS,</p>
<p>Her smile itself ingenuous and coy.</p>
<p>Her greatest oath was only ‘by Saint Loy’,</p>
<p>And she was called Madame Eglentine.</p>
<p>Full well she sung the service, divine,</p>
<p>Intoning through her nose, all seemly,</p>
<p>And fair French she spoke, all elegantly,</p>
<p>After the school of Stratford-atte-Bowe;</p>
<p>For French of Paris was not hers to know.</p>
<p>At meals she had been taught well withal;</p>
<p>And from her lips she let no morsel fall,</p>
<p>Nor dipped her fingers in the sauce too deep;</p>
<p>Well could she take a morsel and then keep</p>
<p>The slightest drop from falling on her breast;</p>
<p>Courtesy it was that pleased her best.</p>
<p>Her upper lip she would wipe so clean</p>
<p>That in her cup no trace of grease was seen</p>
<p>When she had drunk her draught; and to eat,</p>
<p>In a most seemly manner took her meat.</p>
<p>And certainly she had a cheerful manner,</p>
<p>Pleasant and amiable in her behaviour,</p>
<p>Took pains to imitate the ways of court,</p>
<p>Display a stately bearing as she ought,</p>
<p>And be considered worthy of reverence.</p>
<p>As for consideration of her conscience,</p>
<p>She was so charitable, tender, anxious,</p>
<p>She would weep if she but saw a mouse</p>
<p>Caught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.</p>
<p>Of slender hounds she had, that she fed</p>
<p>With roasted flesh, or milk, and fine white bread;</p>
<p>But wept sorely when one of them was dead</p>
<p>Or if men struck it with a stick too hard,</p>
<p>And all was sentiment and tender heart.</p>
<p>Her wimple was pleated in a seemly way,</p>
<p>Her nose was elegant, her eyes blue-grey;</p>
<p>Her lips quite fine, and also soft and red,</p>
<p>But certainly she had a fair forehead,</p>
<p>It was almost a span broad, I deem,</p>
<p>For she was not small of build, I mean.</p>
<p>Her cloak was very elegant, I saw;</p>
<p>Fine coral round her arm she wore</p>
<p>A rosary, the larger beads were green,</p>
<p>And from it hung a brooch of golden sheen,</p>
<p>On which there first was writ a crowned A,</p>
<p>And after: ‘Amor vincit omnia’.</p>
<p>Another NUN she had with her, and she</p>
<p>Was her chaplain, and with them priests three.</p>
<p>A MONK there was, of the highest degree,</p>
<p>Who loved to hunt, agent of a monastery,</p>
<p>A manly man, for an Abbot’s role quite able.</p>
<p>Full many a fine horse had he in his stable,</p>
<p>His bridle, when he rode, men might hear</p>
<p>Jingling in a whistling wind as clear,</p>
<p>And quite as loud as does the chapel bell.</p>
<p>Now as this lord was prior of his cell,</p>
<p>The rule of Saint Benedict and Saint Mawr,</p>
<p>As old and somewhat strict he would ignore,</p>
<p>This same monk scorned the old world’s pace,</p>
<p>And spurred after the new world, apace.</p>
<p>He gave not for that text a plucked hen</p>
<p>That says that hunters are not holy men,</p>
<p>And that a monk when he grows heedless</p>
<p>Is like a fish that’s all waterless –</p>
<p>That is to say a monk out of his cloister –</p>
<p>But he held that text not worth an oyster.</p>
<p>And I agreed his views were scarcely bad:</p>
<p>What! Should he study, drive himself quite mad,</p>
<p>In his cloister over a book must pore,</p>
<p>Or labour with his hands, and toil the more</p>
<p>As Augustine bids? How would the world run?</p>
<p>Let Augustine keep his labour for his own!</p>
<p>Therefore he was a hunting man outright.</p>
<p>Greyhounds he had, as swift as birds in flight;</p>
<p>Tracking with dogs and hunting the hare</p>
<p>Was all his pleasure, no cost did he spare.</p>
<p>I saw his sleeves were trimmed at the wrist</p>
<p>With grey fur, and of the country’s finest;</p>
<p>And to fasten his hood beneath his chin,</p>
<p>He had a wrought-gold elaborate pin;</p>
<p>A love-knot in the larger end there was.</p>
<p>His head was bald, and shone like any glass,</p>
<p>And his face, as if he had been anointed;</p>
<p>He was a lord full fat, and well appointed.</p>
<p>His bulging eyeballs, rolling in his head,</p>
<p>Glowing like a cauldron-fire well-fed;</p>
<p>Supple his boots, his horse in perfect state.</p>
<p>Now certainly he was a fair prelate;</p>
<p>He was not pale like some tormented ghost.</p>
<p>A fat swan he loved best of any roast;</p>
<p>His palfrey was as brown as is a berry.</p>
<p>A FRIAR there was, a wanton one and merry,</p>
<p>A Limiter, a very jovial man.</p>
<p>In all the friars’ four orders none that can</p>
<p>Lead a discussion in fairer language.</p>
<p>And he had arranged many a marriage</p>
<p>Of young women, granting each a dower.</p>
<p>He was a noble pillar of his Order.</p>
<p>Well-beloved and intimate was he</p>
<p>With Franklins within his boundary,</p>
<p>And also worthy women of the town;</p>
<p>Had power to confess coat and gown –</p>
<p>As he said himself – more than a curate,</p>
<p>Having licence from his bishop to do it.</p>
<p>Full sweetly he would hear confessions,</p>
<p>And very pleasant were his absolutions.</p>
<p>He was an easy man at granting penance</p>
<p>From which he made more than a pittance.</p>
<p>When to a poor Order alms are given</p>
<p>It is a token that a man’s well-shriven;</p>
<p>Since he dared claim that from the intent,</p>
<p>Of giving, then the man was penitent.</p>
<p>For many a man is so hard of heart</p>
<p>He cannot weep, though he feels the smart.</p>
<p>Therefore instead of weeping and prayer,</p>
<p>Better to give the poor friars silverware.</p>
<p>His sleeve’s end was stuffed with pocket-knives</p>
<p>And gilded pins, to give to pretty wives.</p>
<p>He could hold a note for sure; could sing</p>
<p>And play quite sweetly on the tuneful string.</p>
<p>Such competitions he won easily.</p>
<p>His neck was white as the fleur-de-lis;</p>
<p>And he was as strong as any champion.</p>
<p>He knew the taverns well in every town,</p>
<p>And all the barmaids and innkeepers,</p>
<p>Rather than the lepers and the beggars</p>
<p>Since such a worthy man as he</p>
<p>It suited not his calling or degree,</p>
<p>With such lepers to maintain acquaintance.</p>
<p>It is not seemly – helps no man advance –</p>
<p>To have dealings with such poor people,</p>
<p>Only with the rich, sellers of victuals.</p>
<p>An everywhere a profit might arise,</p>
<p>He wore a courteous and humble guise;</p>
<p>There was no man half so virtuous.</p>
<p>He was the finest beggar of his house</p>
<p>– and paid a fixed fee for the right;</p>
<p>None of his brethren poached in his sight.</p>
<p>For though a widow lacked a shoe</p>
<p>So pleasant was his ‘In principio’,</p>
<p>He yet would gain a farthing as he went.</p>
<p>His income was far greater than his rent,</p>
<p>And he romped around, like any whelp.</p>
<p>In settling disputes he could help,</p>
<p>Not like a friar from a cloister,</p>
<p>With threadbare cloak, like needy scholar,</p>
<p>But he was like a doctor or a pope;</p>
<p>Of double worsted was his demi-cloak,</p>
<p>A bell shaped from the mould, its fashion.</p>
<p>He lisped a little out of affectation,</p>
<p>To sound his English sweet upon the tongue;</p>
<p>And in his harping, whenever he had sung,</p>
<p>His eyes would twinkle in his head aright</p>
<p>As do the stars on high in frosty night.</p>
<p>Hubert his name, this worthy Limiter.</p>
<p>A MERCHANT was there, with a forked beard,</p>
<p>Dressed in motley, high on horse he sat.</p>
<p>Upon his head a Flemish beaver hat,</p>
<p>Buckled his boots were, fair and neatly.</p>
<p>He made his comments solemnly, fully,</p>
<p>Boasting of profits ever increasing,</p>
<p>Wishing sea-trade secure, more than anything,</p>
<p>Twixt Middleburgh and the River Orwell.</p>
<p>He could exchange monies, buy and sell.</p>
<p>This worthy man made such use of his wits;</p>
<p>No one knew he was beset by debts,</p>
<p>So stately his manner of behaving,</p>
<p>In his bargaining, and money-lending.</p>
<p>Truly a worthy man then, all in all,</p>
<p>But truth to tell, I know not what he’s called.</p>
<p>A CLERK there was of Oxford town also,</p>
<p>Who had set himself to logic long ago.</p>
<p>Thinner was his horse than many a rake,</p>
<p>And he was none too fat, I’ll undertake,</p>
<p>But gazed quite hollowly, and soberly.</p>
<p>His jacket threadbare, where the eye could see;</p>
<p>For he had not yet found a benefice,</p>
<p>Far too unworldly ever to seek office.</p>
<p>He would rather have at his bed-head</p>
<p>Twenty books, clad in black or red,</p>
<p>Of Aristotle and his philosophy,</p>
<p>Than rich robes, fiddle, and sweet psaltery.</p>
<p>But though he was a true philosopher</p>
<p>No stone for making gold lay in his coffer!</p>
<p>But every single penny his friends lent,</p>
<p>On books and on learning it was spent,</p>
<p>And for the souls he offered up a prayer,</p>
<p>Of those who funded him to be a scholar.</p>
<p>Of study he took most care, and most heed.</p>
<p>He spoke not one word more than he need,</p>
<p>And that was formal, said with reverence,</p>
<p>Short, and quick, and in a noble sentence.</p>
<p>Agreeing with moral virtue all his speech,</p>
<p>And gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.</p>
<p>A SERGEANT AT LAW, wise and cautious,</p>
<p>Often consulted at St Paul’s porch and such,</p>
<p>Was also there, rich in excellence.</p>
<p>Discreet he was, a man for reverence –</p>
<p>Or so he seemed, his words being so wise.</p>
<p>He had often been a Justice at assize,</p>
<p>By letters patent and by full commission.</p>
<p>By his science and his high renown</p>
<p>Of fees and robes he garnered many a one.</p>
<p>So great a buyer of land was never known;</p>
<p>All was his in fee-simple, in effect.</p>
<p>His purchases were not the least suspect.</p>
<p>More business than he had, no man has,</p>
<p>And yet he seemed busier than he was.</p>
<p>He had correctly cases, judgements, all</p>
<p>From King William’s time in men’s recall.</p>
<p>Moreover he could draw up anything,</p>
<p>That no man might find fault with its drafting;</p>
<p>And every statute he could cite by rote,</p>
<p>He rode along in a simple striped coat,</p>
<p>Tied with a silken belt, its clasps of metal;</p>
<p>Of his array I will no further tell.</p>
<p>A FRANKLIN was in his company;</p>
<p>White was his beard as is the daisy.</p>
<p>Of his complexion he was sanguine;</p>
<p>He loved a sop in wine each morning.</p>
<p>To live in delight was ever his wont,</p>
<p>For he was Epicurus’ very son,</p>
<p>Who held the view that perfect delight</p>
<p>Was the true felicity outright.</p>
<p>A hospitable householder was he</p>
<p>Saint Julian he was to his county.</p>
<p>His bread and ale always second to none;</p>
<p>And no better wine than his was known.</p>
<p>His house was never short of fish and flesh,</p>
<p>Of pastry dishes, and all so plenteous</p>
<p>It snowed in his house with meat and drink,</p>
<p>And all the dainties of which men might think.</p>
<p>In accordance with the seasons of the year,</p>
<p>So he changed his dinner and his supper.</p>
<p>Full many a fat partridge had he in coop,</p>
<p>And many a bream and pike in the pool.</p>
<p>Woe to his cook unless his sauces were</p>
<p>Pungent and tasty, and every dish prepared!</p>
<p>His table fixed in his hall stood always</p>
<p>Ready set with covers, every day.</p>
<p>At court-sessions he was lord and sire;</p>
<p>And oftentimes was Member for the Shire.</p>
<p>A two-edged dagger and a purse of silk</p>
<p>Hung at his girdle, white as morning milk.</p>
<p>A Sheriff had he been, and a lawyer;</p>
<p>Nowhere lived so worthy a landowner.</p>
<p>A HABERDASHER, CARPENTER, a WEAVER</p>
<p>A DYER too, and TAPESTRY-MAKER,</p>
<p>Were there all clothed in the livery</p>
<p>Of their imposing guild fraternity.</p>
<p>Full fresh and new their costume was;</p>
<p>Their knives were mounted not with brass</p>
<p>But all with silver, wrought clean and well,</p>
<p>Their girdles and their pouches as befell.</p>
<p>Each of them seemed a splendid burgess</p>
<p>Fit to grace a guildhall on a dais.</p>
<p>Each owning as much wisdom as man can,</p>
<p>Was suitable to be an alderman,</p>
<p>For they had property enough and rent,</p>
<p>And wives too who would give their assent.</p>
<p>They would be blamed for sure were it not done;</p>
<p>It is a fine thing to be called ‘Madame’,</p>
<p>And go to vigil before the celebration,</p>
<p>With mantle royally carried, on occasion.</p>
<p>A COOK they had with them I own</p>
<p>To boil the chickens with the marrow-bones,</p>
<p>And pungent flavouring, spices without fail.</p>
<p>Well could he distinguish London ale;</p>
<p>He could roast and seethe and boil and fry,</p>
<p>Make thick soup and bake a tasty pie.</p>
<p>But a mortal pity, it seemed to me,</p>
<p>That on his shin an ulcerous sore had he.</p>
<p>Yet a fricassee, he made it with the best.</p>
<p>A SHIPMAN was there, from out the west;</p>
<p>A Dartmouth man for all I understood.</p>
<p>He rode a hired hack, as best he could,</p>
<p>In a woollen gown that reached his knee,</p>
<p>A dagger hanging on a cord had he,</p>
<p>About his neck, under his arm, and down.</p>
<p>The summer heat had tanned his visage brown.</p>
<p>And certainly he was a splendid fellow;</p>
<p>Full many a draught of wine he made flow</p>
<p>From Bordeaux, the merchant fast asleep,</p>
<p>The nicer rules of conscience did not keep:</p>
<p>If he fought, and gained the upper hand,</p>
<p>He sent men home by water to every land.</p>
<p>As for his skill in calculating tides,</p>
<p>Currents, and every other risk besides,</p>
<p>Harbours and moons, on every voyage,</p>
<p>There was none such from Hull to Carthage.</p>
<p>Hardy he was, wise in his undertakings,</p>
<p>In many a tempest had his beard been shaken.</p>
<p>He knew all the havens that there were</p>
<p>From Gotland’s Isle to Cape Finisterre,</p>
<p>And every creek in Brittany and Spain;</p>
<p>The barque he owned was called the Magdalene.</p>
<p>With us there was a DOCTOR OF PHYSIC.</p>
<p>In all this world none ever saw his like</p>
<p>On points of physic and of surgery,</p>
<p>For he was grounded in astronomy.</p>
<p>He knew the best hours for the sick,</p>
<p>By the power of his natural magic.</p>
<p>And could select the right ascendant</p>
<p>For making talismans for his patient.</p>
<p>He knew the cause of every malady,</p>
<p>Whether of hot or cold, or moist and dry,</p>
<p>And where engendered, of what humour;</p>
<p>He was a truly perfect practitioner.</p>
<p>The cause known, and of the ill its root,</p>
<p>He gave the sick man remedy to suit.</p>
<p>To send him medicines, his apothecaries</p>
<p>And potions too, they were ever ready,</p>
<p>For each enhanced the other’s profiting –</p>
<p>There needed no new friendship there to win.</p>
<p>He was well-versed in Aesculapius,</p>
<p>And Dioscorides and likewise Rufus,</p>
<p>Old Hippocrates, Hali and Galen,</p>
<p>Serapion, Rhazes and Avicen,</p>
<p>Averroes, Damascenus, Constantinus,</p>
<p>Bernard, and Gaddesden, and Gilbertus.</p>
<p>In his diet quite moderate was he,</p>
<p>For it avoided superfluity,</p>
<p>But nourishing it was, digestible.</p>
<p>He made little study of the Bible.</p>
<p>In red and blue, and colours of that ilk,</p>
<p>Lined with taffeta, was clad, and silk.</p>
<p>And yet he was most careful of expense;</p>
<p>He kept the money won from pestilence.</p>
<p>For gold in physic is a cordial;</p>
<p>Therefore he loved gold above all.</p>
<p>A good WIFE was there from next to BATH,</p>
<p>But pity was that she was somewhat deaf.</p>
<p>In cloth-making she was excellent,</p>
<p>Surpassing those of Ypres and of Ghent.</p>
<p>In all the parish there was no wife, so</p>
<p>Before her to the Offertory might go –</p>
<p>And if they did, indeed, so angry she</p>
<p>That she was quite put out of charity.</p>
<p>Her kerchiefs were finely wove I found;</p>
<p>I dare to swear those weighed a good ten pounds,</p>
<p>That on a Sunday she wore on her head.</p>
<p>Here hose were of a fine scarlet red,</p>
<p>And tightly tied: her shoes full soft and new.</p>
<p>Bold was her face, and fair and red of hue.</p>
<p>Had been a worthy woman all her life;</p>
<p>Husbands at the church-door she had five,</p>
<p>Besides other company in her youth –</p>
<p>No need to speak of that just now, in truth.</p>
<p>And thrice had she been to Jerusalem;</p>
<p>She had crossed many a foreign stream.</p>
<p>At Boulogne she had been, and Rome,</p>
<p>St James of Compostella, and Cologne,</p>
<p>And she knew much of wandering by the way,</p>
<p>Gap toothed was she, truthfully to say.</p>
<p>At ease upon a saddle-horse she sat,</p>
<p>Well wimpled, and on her head a hat</p>
<p>As wide as a small buckler or large shield,</p>
<p>Her large hips an over-skirt concealed,</p>
<p>And on her feet a pair of sharp spurs sat.</p>
<p>In fellowship she loved to laugh and chat;</p>
<p>And remedies for love she had, by chance,</p>
<p>For in that art she knew the oldest dance.</p>
<p>A holy man there was of good renown,</p>
<p>Who was a poor PARSON to a town,</p>
<p>But rich he was in holy thought and works.</p>
<p>He also was a learned man, a clerk,</p>
<p>That Christ’s gospel earnestly would preach;</p>
<p>His parishioners devoutly he would teach.</p>
<p>Benign he was and wondrous diligent,</p>
<p>And in adversity extremely patient,</p>
<p>And proven to be such as many times.</p>
<p>He was loth to curse men over tithes,</p>
<p>But preferred to give, without a doubt,</p>
<p>To the poor parishioners round about,</p>
<p>From his own goods and the offerings,</p>
<p>He found sufficiency in little things.</p>
<p>Wide was his parish, and houses far asunder,</p>
<p>But he neglected naught, in rain or thunder,</p>
<p>In sickness or affliction went to all</p>
<p>The farthest in his parish, great or small,</p>
<p>Upon his feet, and in his hand a stave.</p>
<p>This fine example to his flock he gave,</p>
<p>That first he wrought, and afterward he taught.</p>
<p>Out of the gospel he those words had caught;</p>
<p>And this maxim he would add thereto,</p>
<p>That if gold rust, what should iron do?</p>
<p>For if the priest be foul in whom we trust,</p>
<p>No wonder if the layman turn to rust!</p>
<p>And shame it is, and let priests note, to see</p>
<p>The shepherd doused in shit, the sheep still clean.</p>
<p>The true example the priest ought to give</p>
<p>Is by his cleanness how the sheep should live.</p>
<p>He did not set his benefice to hire</p>
<p>And leave his sheep encumbered in the mire,</p>
<p>Running off to London to Saint Paul’s,</p>
<p>To work a wealthy chantry for dead souls,</p>
<p>Or in guild brotherhood remain enrolled</p>
<p>But dwelt at home and cared well for his fold,</p>
<p>So that no wolf should make his task miscarry.</p>
<p>He was a shepherd not a mercenary.</p>
<p>And though he was holy and virtuous,</p>
<p>He did not scorn the sinful, nor because</p>
<p>Of it in speech was proud or over-fine,</p>
<p>But in his teaching was discreet, benign;</p>
<p>To draw folk towards heaven by gentleness,</p>
<p>By good example – such was his business.</p>
<p>But if anyone proved obstinate,</p>
<p>Whoever he was, of high or low estate,</p>
<p>He would rebuke him sharply, him to punish.</p>
<p>A better priest I think there nowhere none is.</p>
<p>He never looked for pomp or reverence,</p>
<p>Nor showed a too fastidious conscience,</p>
<p>But Christ’s lore, and his Apostles’ twelve,</p>
<p>He taught, but first he followed it himself.</p>
<p>With him there was a PLOUGHMAN, was his brother,</p>
<p>Many a load of dung, one time or other,</p>
<p>He had carted, a good true worker he,</p>
<p>Living in peace and perfect charity.</p>
<p>God loved he best with all his whole heart</p>
<p>At all times, whether with delight or smart,</p>
<p>Then his neighbour loved he as himself.</p>
<p>He would thresh the corn, and dig and delve,</p>
<p>For Christ’s sake, grant the poor their hour,</p>
<p>Without reward, if it lay in his power.</p>
<p>His tithes he paid in full, fair and well,</p>
<p>Both of his labour and his capital.</p>
<p>In a loose tunic he rode on a mare.</p>
<p>There was a REEVE also and a MILLER,</p>
<p>A SUMMONER and a PARDONER as well,</p>
<p>A college MANCIPLE, and then myself.</p>
<p>The MILLER was a strong man I own;</p>
<p>A stout fellow, big in brawn and bone.</p>
<p>It served him well, for, everywhere, the man,</p>
<p>At wrestling, always looked to win the ram.</p>
<p>Broad, thick-set, short in the upper arm,</p>
<p>Off its hinges, he lifted any door,</p>
<p>Or ran at it and broke it with his head.</p>
<p>His beard, as any sow or fox, was red,</p>
<p>And broad as well, as if it were a spade.</p>
<p>On the tip of his nose he displayed</p>
<p>A wart, and on it stood a tuft of hair,</p>
<p>Red as the bristles in a sow’s ear.</p>
<p>His nostrils were as black as they were wide;</p>
<p>A sword and buckler he wore at his side.</p>
<p>His mouth as great was as a great furnace.</p>
<p>He was a loudmouth and to his disgrace</p>
<p>Told stories most of sin and harlotry.</p>
<p>He stole corn, and made one toll pay three;</p>
<p>Yet had the golden thumb, a mystery!</p>
<p>A white coat and a blue hood wore he;</p>
<p>The bagpipes he could blow well and sound,</p>
<p>And that was how he piped us out of town.</p>
<p>The MANCIPLE was of the Inner Temple,</p>
<p>All purchasers might follow his example</p>
<p>Of wisdom in the buying of victuals;</p>
<p>For whether he paid cash or owed it all</p>
<p>He was so careful always in his purchase,</p>
<p>That he was all prepared and acted first.</p>
<p>Now is it not a wonder of God’s grace</p>
<p>That a man so illiterate can outpace</p>
<p>The wisdom of a host of learned men?</p>
<p>Of masters he had more than thrice ten,</p>
<p>Expert in the law and meritorious,</p>
<p>Of whom there were a dozen in that house</p>
<p>Worthy to be stewards of rent and land</p>
<p>For any lord who lives in England,</p>
<p>And show him the income to be had   </p>
<p>Debt-free, from his estates, less he were mad,</p>
<p>Or be as frugal as he should desire;</p>
<p>And they were able to assist a shire</p>
<p>In any case that chanced to arise –</p>
<p>And yet this Manciple outdid the wise.</p>
<p>The REEVE was a slender, choleric man.</p>
<p>His beard was shaved as close as any can;</p>
<p>His hair by his ears was fully shorn;</p>
<p>The top was cropped like a priest before.</p>
<p>His legs were long, and very lean,</p>
<p>Like sticks they were – no calves to be seen.</p>
<p>He kept a tidy granary and bin;</p>
<p>No auditor could get the best of him.</p>
<p>Well could he judge from drought or rain</p>
<p>The yield of his seed and of his grain.</p>
<p>His lord’s sheep, beef-cattle, and his dairy,</p>
<p>His swine, his horses, stock and poultry,</p>
<p>Was wholly in this Reeve’s governance</p>
<p>And he made reckoning by covenant,</p>
<p>Since his lord had only twenty years;</p>
<p>No man could find him ever in arrears.</p>
<p>No bailiff, cowherd, servant of any kind</p>
<p>But their deceits and tricks were in his mind;</p>
<p>They feared him like the plague, is my belief.</p>
<p>He had a pleasant dwelling on a heath,</p>
<p>With green trees shadowed was the sward.</p>
<p>He could purchase better than his lord;</p>
<p>He had riches of his own privately.</p>
<p>He could please his lord subtly,</p>
<p>Giving and lending of his own goods,</p>
<p>And earn his thank you and a coat and hood.</p>
<p>In youth he had a good and learned master;</p>
<p>He was a fine craftsman, a carpenter.</p>
<p>This Reeve sat on a farm-horse that was</p>
<p>All dappled grey and bore the name of Scot.</p>
<p>A long bluish top-coat he displayed,</p>
<p>And by his side he bore a rusty blade.</p>
<p>Of Norfolk was this Reeve of whom I tell,</p>
<p>Near a town that men call Bawdeswell.</p>
<p>His gown was tucked up like a friar’s about,</p>
<p>And he always rode the hindmost on the route.</p>
<p>A SUMMONER was with us in that place,</p>
<p>Who had a fiery-red cherubim’s face,</p>
<p>Carbuncled so, and his eyes were narrow.</p>
<p>He was hot and lecherous as a sparrow,</p>
<p>With scabby black brows and scrubby beard;</p>
<p>Of his visage children were a-feared.</p>
<p>No quicksilver, lead salve, or brimstone,</p>
<p>Borax, ceruse, or oil of tartar known,</p>
<p>No ointment that would cleanse and bite,</p>
<p>Could cure him of his pimples white,</p>
<p>Or of the lumps rising from his cheeks.</p>
<p>Well loved he garlic, onions, and leeks,</p>
<p>And to drink strong wine, as red as blood;</p>
<p>Making him speak, and cry, as madman would.</p>
<p>And when he had drunk, and the wine was in,</p>
<p>Then he would speak no word but Latin.</p>
<p>A few tags he had, some two or three,</p>
<p>That he had learned out of some decree –</p>
<p>No wonder, since he heard them every day.</p>
<p>And you well know moreover how a jay</p>
<p>Can say ‘Walter’ better than the Pope –</p>
<p>But try any other matter’s scope,</p>
<p>Then had he spent all his philosophy;</p>
<p>Ay ‘Questio quid iuris’ was his plea.</p>
<p>He was a noble rogue and a kind;</p>
<p>A better fellow no man could find.</p>
<p>He would allow, for a quart of wine,</p>
<p>A good friend to keep a concubine</p>
<p>A twelvemonth and excuse him fully;</p>
<p>And he could pluck a fool privately.</p>
<p>And if he made a good friend anywhere,</p>
<p>He would teach him not to have a care</p>
<p>In such a case of the Archdeacon’s curse,</p>
<p>Unless a man’s soul lay in his purse,</p>
<p>For in his purse he should punished be.</p>
<p>‘The purse is the Archdeacon’s hell,’ said he.</p>
<p>But well I know he lied in what he said;</p>
<p>For his curse each guilty man should dread,</p>
<p>Since absolution saves, but slays that writ,</p>
<p>And so ware of that word Significavit.</p>
<p>He had in his power as he pleased</p>
<p>All the young folk of the diocese,</p>
<p>Knew their secrets, they by him were led.</p>
<p>A garland had he set upon his head,</p>
<p>Big as an inn-sign’s holly on a stake;</p>
<p>A buckler he had made him of a cake.</p>
<p>With him there rode a noble PARDONER</p>
<p>Of Charing Cross, his friend and his peer,</p>
<p>Returned directly from the Court of Rome.</p>
<p>He sang out loud: ‘Come hither, love, to me!’</p>
<p>The Summoner sang a powerful bass around;</p>
<p>Never a trumpet of half so great a sound.</p>
<p>The Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,</p>
<p>But smooth it hung like a hank of flax.</p>
<p>In clusters hung the locks he possessed,</p>
<p>With which his shoulders he overspread;</p>
<p>But thin they fell, in strands, one by one.</p>
<p>But hood, to adorn them, he wore none,</p>
<p>For it was trussed up in his wallet –</p>
<p>He thought he rode fashionably set;</p>
<p>Dishevelled, save his cap, he rode all bare.</p>
<p>Such bulging eyeballs had he as a hare.</p>
<p>A pilgrim badge had he sewn on his cap;</p>
<p>His wallet lay before him in his lap,</p>
<p>Brimful of pardons, come from Rome hotfoot.</p>
<p>A voice he had as small as has a goat;</p>
<p>No beard had he, nor ever looked to have;</p>
<p>As smooth it were as it were lately shaved –</p>
<p>I judge he was a gelding or a mare.</p>
<p>But of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware,</p>
<p>Never was such another Pardoner.</p>
<p>And in his bag a pillow-case was there,</p>
<p>Which he claimed was Our Lady’s veil;</p>
<p>He said he had a fragment of the sail</p>
<p>That Saint Peter used, when he skimmed</p>
<p>Upon the sea till Jesus summoned him.</p>
<p>He had a cross of brass set with stones,</p>
<p>And in a glass, he had pigs’ bones.</p>
<p>And with these relics, when he had to hand</p>
<p>Some poor parson living on the land,</p>
<p>In one day he gathered in more money</p>
<p>Than the parson in a month of Sundays.</p>
<p>And thus with feigned flattery, his japes</p>
<p>Made people and the parson his apes.</p>
<p>But to tell true from first to last,</p>
<p>He was in church a noble ecclesiast.</p>
<p>He read a lesson well or a story,</p>
<p>But best of all he sang an Offertory.</p>
<p>For well he knew, when that song was sung,</p>
<p>He must preach and well tune his tongue</p>
<p>To win silver, as he well knew how;</p>
<p>Therefore he sang more sweetly and loud.</p>
<p>Now I have told you in a brief clause,</p>
<p>The array, condition, number and the cause</p>
<p>Whereby assembled was this company,</p>
<p>In Southwark at that noble hostelry</p>
<p>Called The Tabard, fast by The Bell.</p>

<p>But now the time has come for me to tell</p>
<p>How we behaved on that same night,</p>
<p>At that hostelry where we did alight;</p>
<p>And after will I tell, at every stage,</p>
<p>All the remainder of our pilgrimage.</p>
<p>But first I pray you of your courtesy,</p>
<p>Not to consider me unmannerly</p>
<p>If I speak plainly in this matter,</p>
<p>In telling you their words hereafter,</p>
<p>Though I speak their words literally;</p>
<p>For this you know as well as me,</p>
<p>Whoso tells the tale of another man</p>
<p>Must repeat as closely as he can</p>
<p>Every word, if it be in his power,</p>
<p>However coarse or broad his dower</p>
<p>Of words, or else his tale will be untrue,</p>
<p>Or feign things, inventing words anew.</p>
<p>He may spare none, though it were his brother,</p>
<p>Must say the one word if he says the other.</p>
<p>Christ himself spoke plain in Holy Writ,</p>
<p>And you well know no coarseness is in it.</p>
<p>As Plato says, to any who can read,</p>
<p>The words must be cousin to the deed.</p>
<p>Also I beg you, if you will, forgive me</p>
<p>If I have not placed folk in due degree</p>
<p>Here in this tale, as they indeed should stand;</p>
<p>I lack the wit, you may well understand.</p>
<p>Our HOST made great cheer for everyone,</p>
<p>And down to supper set us all anon.</p>
<p>He served us with victuals of the best:</p>
<p>Strong was the wine, we drank with zest.</p>
<p>A handsome man our Host was withal,</p>
<p>And fit to be a marshal in a hall.</p>
<p>A large man he was with striking eyes;</p>
<p>No fairer burgess was there in Cheapside.</p>
<p>Bold in his speech, and wise, and well taught,</p>
<p>And of honest manhood he lacked naught.</p>
<p>Add that he was a truly merry man;</p>
<p>And after supper jokingly began</p>
<p>To speak of entertainment and other things,</p>
<p>After we had paid our reckonings,</p>
<p>Saying to us: ‘Now lordings, truly</p>
<p>To me you are right welcome, heartily!</p>
<p>For by my troth and telling you no lie,</p>
<p>I have not seen this year such folk go by</p>
<p>As gathered together in this tavern now.</p>
<p>And I would entertain, if I knew how,</p>
<p>Yet there is an entertainment, in my thoughts,</p>
<p>To amuse you and it will cost you naught.</p>
<p>You go to Canterbury – God you speed!</p>
<p>May the blissful martyr bless you indeed! –</p>
<p>And well I know, as you go on your way</p>
<p>You intend to chatter and make hay.</p>
<p>For truly, comfort and delight is none</p>
<p>In riding on the way dumb as a stone.</p>
<p>And therefore I offer you some sport,</p>
<p>As I first said, to give you some comfort.</p>
<p>And if you agree as one and consent</p>
<p>Each of you to accept my judgement,</p>
<p>And to work it as I to you will say,</p>
<p>Tomorrow when you ride on your way,</p>
<p>Now, by my father’s soul, he being dead,</p>
<p>If you lack merriment, be it on my head!</p>
<p>Hold up your hands, without longer speech.’</p>
<p>Our decision was not long to seek:</p>
<p>We thought it not worth serious debating,</p>
<p>And gave him leave, without deliberating,</p>
<p>And bade him give his orders as he wished,</p>
<p>‘Lordings,’ quoth he, ‘now listen to the rest –</p>
<p>But hear me out, I pray, without disdain –</p>
<p>Here is the point, to tell you short and plain:</p>
<p>That each of you, to speed you on your way,</p>
<p>On the journey there, shall tell two tales,</p>
<p>Till Canterbury, I mean it so,</p>
<p>And on the homeward way another two,</p>
<p>Of adventures that did once befall.</p>
<p>And which of you that bears them best of all –</p>
<p>That is to say, who tells in this case</p>
<p>Tales the most serious that most solace –</p>
<p>Shall have a supper and we pay the cost,</p>
<p>Here in this place, sitting by this post,</p>
<p>When that we come again from Canterbury.</p>
<p>And to make you all the more merry,</p>
<p>I will myself gladly with you ride,</p>
<p>All at my own cost, and be your guide.</p>
<p>And whoever my judgement does gainsay</p>
<p>Shall pay all that we spend by the way.</p>
<p>And if you will agree it shall be so,</p>
<p>Tell me now, without more ado,</p>
<p>And I will get me ready for the dawn.’</p>
<p>The thing was agreed, and our oath sworn</p>
<p>With right good heart, and we begged also</p>
<p>That he accordingly would do so,</p>
<p>And that he act then as our governor,</p>
<p>And of our tales be judge and recorder,</p>
<p>And fix the supper at a certain price,</p>
<p>And we would be ruled by his device,</p>
<p>In high and low, and thus by one assent</p>
<p>We all agreed to his true judgement.</p>
<p>And the wine was brought, thereupon</p>
<p>We drank, and to rest went everyone,</p>
<p>Without our any longer tarrying.</p>
<p>Next morning, when the day began to spring,</p>
<p>Up rose our Host and roused us like the cock,</p>
<p>And gathered us together in a flock;</p>
<p>And forth we rode, at barely walking-pace</p>
<p>To Saint Thomas, and his watering place.</p>
<p>And there our Host held the reins still,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Lordings, hearken if you will!</p>
<p>You know what you agreed, as I record.</p>
<p>If even-song and morning-song accord,</p>
<p>Let us see who shall tell the first tale.</p>
<p>As ever I hope to drink wine and ale,</p>
<p>Whoever is a rebel to my judgement</p>
<p>Shall pay for all that on the way is spent.</p>
<p>Now draw a straw before our journeying;</p>
<p>And he that has the shortest shall begin.</p>
<p>‘Sir Knight,’ quoth he, ‘my master and my lord,</p>
<p>Now make the draw for that is our accord.</p>
<p>Come near,’ quoth he, ‘my lady Prioress,</p>
<p>And you, Sir Cleric, hide your bashfulness,</p>
<p>No pondering now – a hand from everyone!’</p>
<p>At once by each the draw was begun;</p>
<p>And to tell you how it was, as I relate,</p>
<p>Whether by happenstance or chance or fate,</p>
<p>The truth is this: the lot fell to the Knight,</p>
<p>Which filled us all with joy and delight.</p>
<p>And tell his tale he must, in due season,</p>
<p>According to our pact and our decision,</p>
<p>As you have heard – what needs more ado?</p>
<p>And when this good man saw that it was so,</p>
<p>As he was wise and given to obedience</p>
<p>And keeping promises with free assent,</p>
<p>He said: ‘Since I shall begin the game,</p>
<p>Why, welcome is the outcome, in God’s name!</p>
<p>Now let us ride, and hark at what I say.’</p>
<p>And with that word we rode forth on our way,</p>
<p>And he began, all merry and full of cheer</p>
<p>His tale anon, and spoke as you may hear.</p>

<p>Once on a time, as old stories tell us,</p>
<p>There was a Duke whose name was Theseus.</p>
<p>Of Athens he was lord and governor,</p>
<p>And in his time so great a conqueror</p>
<p>Mightier was there none under the sun.</p>
<p>Full many a rich land had he won,</p>
<p>What with his wisdom and his chivalry.</p>
<p>He conquered all the Amazon country,</p>
<p>That long ago was known as Scythia,</p>
<p>And wedded its queen Hippolyta,</p>
<p>And brought her home to his own country</p>
<p>With much glory and great festivity,</p>
<p>And also her young sister Emily.</p>
<p>And so with victory and melody</p>
<p>I’ll let this noble Duke to Athens ride</p>
<p>And all his host in arms him beside.</p>
<p>And were it not indeed too long to hear,</p>
<p>I would have told you fully of the manner</p>
<p>In which the Amazon kingdom was seized</p>
<p>By Theseus and by his chivalry,</p>
<p>And of the great battle on occasion</p>
<p>Twixt the Athenian and the Amazon,</p>
<p>And how he besieged Hippolyta,</p>
<p>The brave and lovely queen of Scythia,</p>
<p>And of the feast they had at their wedding</p>
<p>And of the tempest at their home-coming;</p>
<p>But all of that I must omit for now.</p>
<p>I have, God knows, a large field to plough,</p>
<p>Weak oxen pull my blade, the field is rough.</p>
<p>The remnant of my tale is long enough.</p>
<p>Likewise I’ll not delay us on the route;</p>
<p>Let every fellow tell his tale about,</p>
<p>And let us see who shall that supper win!</p>
<p>– Where I left off, I will again begin.</p>
<p>This Duke of whom I now make mention,</p>
<p>When he was almost come into the town,</p>
<p>In all his splendour and his great pride,</p>
<p>Became aware, as he glanced aside,</p>
<p>That there kneeled in the highway</p>
<p>Two by two, a company of ladies,</p>
<p>One behind the other, in clothes black.</p>
<p>But such a wail, such cries they made, alack,</p>
<p>That in this world there is no creature living</p>
<p>That ever heard another such lamenting.</p>
<p>And this crying was not heard to cease</p>
<p>Till they the reins of his bridle seized.</p>
<p>‘What folk are you that at my home-coming</p>
<p>So disturb my feast with your crying?</p>
<p>Quoth Theseus. ‘Do you so envy my</p>
<p>Honour that thus you complain and cry?</p>
<p>Who has maltreated you or offended?</p>
<p>And tell me if what’s done may be amended,</p>
<p>And why you are clothed thus all in black.’</p>
<p>The eldest lady of them all spoke back,</p>
<p>Swooning, so deathly-white she did appear,</p>
<p>That it was pitiful to see and hear,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Lord to whom Fortune doth give</p>
<p>Victory, you who as a conqueror do live,</p>
<p>We do not mourn your glory and honour,</p>
<p>But we beseech your mercy and succour.</p>
<p>Have mercy on our woe and our distress!</p>
<p>Some drop of pity, in your graciousness,</p>
<p>Upon us wretched women let it fall.</p>
<p>For sure, my lord, there is none of us all</p>
<p>That has not been a duchess or a queen.</p>
<p>Now we are captives, as can well be seen,</p>
<p>Thanks be to Fortune and her fickle wheel,</p>
<p>That no estate lets full assurance feel.</p>
<p>Indeed, lord, to attend your presence we</p>
<p>In this divine temple of Clemency</p>
<p>Have been waiting all this long fortnight.</p>
<p>Now help us lord, since you possess the might!</p>
<p>I, wretched Queen, that weep and wail thus</p>
<p>Was once the wife of King Capaneus</p>
<p>Who died at Thebes – accursed be the day! –</p>
<p>And all of us in all our sad array</p>
<p>Who are making this fond lamentation,</p>
<p>We all lost our husbands in that town,</p>
<p>While the siege thereabout it lay.</p>
<p>And yet now old Creon, sad to say,</p>
<p>That is now the lord of Thebes the city,</p>
<p>Filled full with anger and iniquity,</p>
<p>He out of spite, and out of tyranny,</p>
<p>To do the dead bodies villainy</p>
<p>Of all our lords that have been slain,</p>
<p>Has all the bodies in a heap lain,</p>
<p>And will not give his order and assent</p>
<p>For them to be buried or be burnt,</p>
<p>But lets the dogs eat them, out of spite.’</p>
<p>And with that word, without more respite,</p>
<p>They fell prone and cried piteously:</p>
<p>Have on us wretched women some mercy,</p>
<p>And let our sorrow penetrate your heart!’</p>
<p>The noble Duke with pity gave a start,</p>
<p>Leapt from his horse as he heard her speak.</p>
<p>He thought that his own heart would break</p>
<p>At seeing such piteous victims of fate,</p>
<p>That had once been of such great estate.</p>
<p>And raised them in his arms, and then</p>
<p>Comforted them with generous intent,</p>
<p>And swore his oath, as being a true knight,</p>
<p>He would so vigorously apply his might</p>
<p>To the tyrant Creon, vengeance on him wreak,</p>
<p>That all the people of Greece would speak</p>
<p>Of how Theseus their Creon served,</p>
<p>As one whose death was richly deserved.</p>
<p>And at once, with little more delay,</p>
<p>He rode forth, his banner did display</p>
<p>Towards Thebes, and all his host beside.</p>
<p>No nearer Athens would he go or ride,</p>
<p>Nor rest at ease scarcely half a day,</p>
<p>But onward on his way that night he lay,</p>
<p>And sent, at once, the Queen, Hippolyta,</p>
<p>And Emily, her beautiful young sister,</p>
<p>To the town of Athens there to dwell,</p>
<p>And forth he rode; there is no more to tell.</p>
<p>The image of red Mars, with spear and shield</p>
<p>So shone on his white banners, in the field,</p>
<p>That all the meadows glittered up and down,</p>
<p>And with his banner, his pennon of renown,</p>
<p>Of gold full rich, on which there was a beast,</p>
<p>The Minotaur, whom he had slain in Crete.</p>
<p>So rode the Duke, so rode this conqueror,</p>
<p>And in his host of chivalry the flower,</p>
<p>Till he came to Thebes, there did alight,</p>
<p>Fair in a field, where he thought to fight.</p>
<p>But to speak briefly now of this thing,</p>
<p>With Creon, he that was of Thebes king,</p>
<p>He fought, and slew him like a manly knight</p>
<p>In open battle, and put the folk to flight.</p>
<p>And by assault he won the city after,</p>
<p>And razed the walls, every spar and rafter;</p>
<p>And to the ladies he restored again</p>
<p>The bones of their husbands that were slain,</p>
<p>To perform their obsequies, in usual guise.</p>
<p>Though it were all too long to devise</p>
<p>The great clamour and the sad lamenting</p>
<p>That the ladies made at the burning</p>
<p>Of the bodies, and the great honour</p>
<p>That Theseus the noble conqueror</p>
<p>Did the ladies, when their way they went;</p>
<p>For to speak briefly, such is my intent.</p>
<p>When that this worthy Duke, this Theseus,</p>
<p>Had slain Creon and conquered Thebes thus,</p>
<p>Still in the field he took all night his rest,</p>
<p>And with the country did as pleased him best.</p>
<p>To ransack the heaped bodies of the dead,</p>
<p>To strip them of armour, and clothes indeed,</p>
<p>The pillagers worked busily, with care,</p>
<p>After the battle and the victory there.</p>
<p>And it so befell that in the heap they found,</p>
<p>Pierced with many a grievous bloody wound,</p>
<p>Two young knights, lying side by side,</p>
<p>Both in like armour, richly wrought beside;</p>
<p>Of whom, Arcita was the name of one,</p>
<p>That of the other knight was Palamon.</p>
<p>Not fully quick nor fully dead they were,</p>
<p>But by their coats of arms and their gear</p>
<p>The heralds knew them, amongst them all,</p>
<p>And that they were of the blood royal</p>
<p>Of Thebes, and of two sisters born.</p>
<p>Out of the heap the pillagers have them borne</p>
<p>And gently carry them to Theseus’ tent</p>
<p>And he at once has them swiftly sent</p>
<p>To Athens, to be confined in prison</p>
<p>Perpetually; allowing them no ransom.</p>
<p>And when the noble Duke had so done,</p>
<p>He took his horse and home he rode anon,</p>
<p>Crowned with laurel as a conqueror;</p>
<p>And there he lived in joy and in honour</p>
<p>All his life; what more need I say now?</p>
<p>And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,</p>
<p>Dwelled this Arcita and this Palamon,</p>
<p>For ever; no gold could buy their freedom.</p>
<p>So passed year on year, and day on day,</p>
<p>Until one morning in the month of May</p>
<p>Young Emily, she fairer to be seen</p>
<p>Than is the lily on its stalk of green,</p>
<p>And fresher than the May with flowers new –</p>
<p>For with the rose’s colour strove her hue;</p>
<p>I know not which was finer of the two –</p>
<p>Ere it was day, as she was wont to do,</p>
<p>She has risen, and dressed at first light,</p>
<p>For May will have no slothfulness a-night,</p>
<p>The season pricks at every gentle heart,</p>
<p>And makes it from its sleep begin to start,</p>
<p>And says: ‘Arise, perform your observance!’</p>
<p>And this made Emily rouse her remembrance</p>
<p>Of the honour due to May, and so to rise.</p>
<p>She was clothed fresh to watching eyes;</p>
<p>Her yellow hair was braided in a tress</p>
<p>Behind her back, a yard long, I guess.</p>
<p>And in the garden, as the sun up-rose,</p>
<p>She walked up and down, and as she chose</p>
<p>Gathered flowers, mingled, white and red,</p>
<p>To make a woven garland for her head,</p>
<p>And sang like an angel, as she went along.</p>

<p>The great tower, that was so thick and strong,</p>
<p>That of the castle was the chief dungeon,</p>
<p>In which the knights were imprisoned,</p>
<p>Of which I told, and will tell you all,</p>
<p>Was closely bonded to the garden wall</p>
<p>Near which this Emily did her walking.</p>
<p>Bright was the sun and clear that morning,</p>
<p>And Palamon, that woeful prisoner,</p>
<p>As was his wont, by leave of his gaoler,</p>
<p>Had risen and he roamed a room on high,</p>
<p>Where all the noble city met his eye,</p>
<p>And so the garden, full of branches green,</p>
<p>Where this fresh Emily the sweetly seen</p>
<p>Was at play, and she roamed up and down.</p>
<p>This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon,</p>
<p>Pacing the chamber, roaming to and fro</p>
<p>And to himself complaining of his woe;</p>
<p>That he was born, he often cried ‘alas!’</p>
<p>And so it befell, by chance or happenstance,</p>
<p>That through a window, thick with many a bar</p>
<p>Of iron large and square as any spar,</p>
<p>He cast his eye upon Emilia,</p>
<p>And thereupon he blanched, and cried ‘Ah!’</p>
<p>As though he had been stung to the heart.</p>
<p>And with that cry Arcita gave a start</p>
<p>And said: ‘My cousin, what aileth thee,</p>
<p>Who are so pale and death-like to see?</p>
<p>Why did you cry out? Who gives offence?</p>
<p>For God’s love, show every patience</p>
<p>With our prison, not otherwise can it be!</p>
<p>Fortune has sent us this adversity.</p>
<p>Some weak aspect or disposition</p>
<p>Of Saturn, in some configuration,</p>
<p>Has yielded this, however we have sworn;</p>
<p>So stood the heavens when that we were born.</p>
<p>We must endure; that is the short and plain.’</p>
<p>And Palamon answered, and spoke again:</p>
<p>‘Cousin, indeed, you are in confusion,</p>
<p>You are deceived in your imagination.</p>
<p>This gaol was not the reason for my cry,</p>
<p>But I was wounded now, through the eye</p>
<p>To the heart, it will be the death of me.</p>
<p>The beauty of that lady that I see</p>
<p>Yonder in the garden roaming to and fro</p>
<p>Is the cause of all my crying and my woe.</p>
<p>I know not if she be woman or a goddess,</p>
<p>But Venus she is in truth, I’d guess.’</p>
<p>And with that on his knees down he fell</p>
<p>And said: Venus, if it be your will</p>
<p>To appear before me in this figure</p>
<p>In that garden, a sorrowful wretched creature,</p>
<p>Out of this prison help us to escape.</p>
<p>And if my destiny is already shaped</p>
<p>By eternal word to die in prison,</p>
<p>On our lineage have some compassion,</p>
<p>That is brought so low by tyranny.’</p>
<p>And at that word Arcita chanced to see</p>
<p>This lady as she roamed to and fro,</p>
<p>And at the sight her beauty hurt him so,</p>
<p>That if Palamon had been wounded sore,</p>
<p>Arcita hurts as much as him or more.</p>
<p>And with a sigh he says piteously:</p>
<p>‘The fresh beauty slays me suddenly</p>
<p>Of her that roams about in yonder place,</p>
<p>And but I have her mercy and her grace,</p>
<p>That I may see her, at the least, some way,</p>
<p>I am but dead; there is no more to say.’</p>
<p>Now Palamon when he heard these words,</p>
<p>Looked at him angrily and so answered:</p>
<p>‘Say you this in earnest, or in play?’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth Arcita, ‘in earnest, by my faith!</p>
<p>God help me so, I have no wish to play.’</p>
<p>Palamon began to knit his brow, and say:</p>
<p>‘There accrues to you,’ he quoth, ‘no honour</p>
<p>In being false, or proving now a traitor</p>
<p>To me, who am your cousin and your brother</p>
<p>Deeply sworn, and each bound to the other,</p>
<p>That never, lest we both may die in pain,</p>
<p>Never, until death shall part us twain,</p>
<p>Shall either in love be hindrance to the other,</p>
<p>Nor in any other way, my dear brother,</p>
<p>Rather you should truly further me</p>
<p>In every case, as I shall further thee.</p>
<p>This was your oath and mine also, I say,</p>
<p>I know in truth you dare not it gainsay.</p>
<p>So are you my confidant, beyond doubt.</p>
<p>And now you will falsely be about</p>
<p>Loving my lady, whom I love and serve</p>
<p>And ever shall, as long as heart deserve.</p>
<p>Now indeed, false Arcita, you shall not so!</p>
<p>I loved her first, and told you of my woe</p>
<p>As my confidant, and my brother sworn</p>
<p>To further me, as I have said before.</p>
<p>By which you are bound as a true knight</p>
<p>To help me, if it lies within your might,</p>
<p>Or else you will prove false, I dare maintain!’</p>
<p>Then Arcita proudly answered him again:</p>
<p>‘You shall,’ he quoth, ‘rather be false than I.</p>
<p>And you are false, I tell you that outright;</p>
<p>For par amour I loved her first, not you.</p>
<p>What did you say? You scarcely knew</p>
<p>Whether she was a woman or a goddess? </p>
<p>Your is affection born of holiness,</p>
<p>And mine is love as for the creature,</p>
<p>And that is why I told you at a venture,</p>
<p>Being my cousin and my brother sworn.</p>
<p>Suppose it so that you loved her before:</p>
<p>Do you not know the old clerks’ saw,</p>
<p>‘Who shall bind a lover with the law?’</p>
<p>Love is a greater law, by head and hand,</p>
<p>Than is imposed by any earthly man.</p>
<p>And therefore social laws and such decrees</p>
<p>Are broken each day for love, by all degrees.</p>
<p>A man must love, despite himself, give heed;</p>
<p>He may not flee it though he die, indeed,</p>
<p>Be she a maid, a widow, or a wife.</p>
<p>And then you are little likely, in this life,</p>
<p>To stand in grace with her; no more shall I.</p>
<p>You know too well, yourself, and no lie,</p>
<p>That you and I are condemned to prison</p>
<p>Perpetually; and granted no ransom</p>
<p>We strive as the hounds did for the bone;</p>
<p>They fought all day and neither did it own.</p>
<p>There came a kite, while they were waxing wrath,</p>
<p>And carried off the bone between them both.</p>
<p>And therefore, at the king’s court, my brother,</p>
<p>Each man for himself; law there’s none other.</p>
<p>Love if you wish; I love, and ever shall.</p>
<p>And truly believe, brother, this is all:</p>
<p>Here in this prison must we endure;</p>
<p>And each of us our own chance assure.’</p>
<p>Great was the strife and long between the two,</p>
<p>If I had leisure to tell it all to you.</p>
<p>But to the point: it happened on a day,</p>
<p>To explain it as briefly as I may,</p>
<p>A worthy Duke, named Pirithous,</p>
<p>Who had been friends with Duke Theseus</p>
<p>Since the days when they were children,</p>
<p>Had come to Athens, visiting his friend,</p>
<p>And to amuse himself as he would do;</p>
<p>For in this world he loved no man so,</p>
<p>And he was loved as tenderly again.</p>
<p>So well they loved, as the old books say,</p>
<p>That when the one was dead, true to tell,</p>
<p>His friend went and sought him down in Hell.</p>
<p>But that is not the story I write here.</p>
<p>Duke Pirithous truly loved Arcita,</p>
<p>And knew him well at Thebes many a year,</p>
<p>And finally, at the request and prayer</p>
<p>Of Pirithous, without any ransom,</p>
<p>Duke Theseus let him out of prison,</p>
<p>To go free, wherever he might choose,</p>
<p>In such a guise as I shall tell to you.</p>
<p>This was the pledge, let me plainly write,</p>
<p>Between Theseus and Arcita, this I cite,</p>
<p>That if so be it Arcita was found,</p>
<p>Ever in life, by day or night, on ground</p>
<p>That in any way belonged to Theseus,</p>
<p>And he were caught, it was agreed thus:</p>
<p>That with a sword he should lose his head.</p>
<p>There was no other remedy be it said,</p>
<p>But to take his leave, and homeward step.</p>
<p>Let him beware; his pledge is now his neck.</p>
<p>How great a sorrow Arcita reveals!</p>
<p>The stroke of death in his heart he feels.</p>
<p>He weeps, he wails, he cries piteously;</p>
<p>He waits to slay himself secretly.</p>
<p>He says: ‘Alas the day that I was born!</p>
<p>Now is my prison worse than before;</p>
<p>Now am I doomed eternally to dwell</p>
<p>Not in Purgatory, but in Hell.</p>
<p>Alas that ever I knew Perithous!</p>
<p>Else I had dwelt with Theseus</p>
<p>Fettered in his prison, evermore so;</p>
<p>Then had I been in bliss, and not in woe.</p>
<p>Only the sight of she whom I serve,</p>
<p>Though that I never her grace may deserve,</p>
<p>Would have sufficed right enough for me.</p>
<p>‘O dear cousin Palamon,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Yours is the victory in this venture!</p>
<p>Full blissfully in prison you endure –</p>
<p>In prison? No, for sure, in Paradise.</p>
<p>Well for you has Fortune cast the dice,</p>
<p>You have sight of her, and I the absence.</p>
<p>For it is possible, since you have her present,</p>
<p>And are a knight, and one noble and able,</p>
<p>That by chance, since Fortune’s changeable,</p>
<p>You may sometime your desire attain.</p>
<p>But I that am exiled, destitute again</p>
<p>Of all grace, and in such great despair</p>
<p>That neither earth nor water, fire nor air,</p>
<p>Nor creature that of them compounded is,</p>
<p>May help me or comfort me in this,</p>
<p>Now I must die in sadness and distress.</p>
<p>Farewell my life, my joy, and my gladness!</p>
<p>Alas, why do folk in general moan</p>
<p>About God’s providence or Fortune,</p>
<p>That often yields to them in many a guise</p>
<p>Much better fates than they themselves devise?</p>
<p>Some man is so desirous of riches,</p>
<p>They cause his murder, or a great sickness.</p>
<p>Another man that would his freedom gain,</p>
<p>Is freed, then by his own household slain.</p>
<p>Infinite harm is hidden in this matter;</p>
<p>We know not what it is we pray for here.</p>
<p>We fare as one that drunk is as a mouse:</p>
<p>A drunken man knows he has a house,</p>
<p>But knows not the right way thither,</p>
<p>And to a drunken man it’s slide and slither.</p>
<p>And that is how for sure in this world we</p>
<p>Go searching hard to find felicity,</p>
<p>But we go wrong so often, tell no lie.</p>
<p>Thus may we all say, and so will I,</p>
<p>That had gone and formed the grand opinion</p>
<p>That if I might escape from prison,</p>
<p>Then I would be in joy and perfect health,</p>
<p>Where instead I am exiled from my wealth,</p>
<p>Since that I may not see you, Emily.</p>
<p>I am but dead; there is no remedy.’</p>
<p>Now on the other hand Palamon,</p>
<p>When he knew that Arcita had gone,</p>
<p>Such sorrow made that the great tower</p>
<p>Echoed to his yowling and his clamour.</p>
<p>The very fetters on his shins yet</p>
<p>Were with his bitter salt tears wet.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth he, ‘Arcita, cousin mine,</p>
<p>Of all our strife, God knows, comes meagre wine!</p>
<p>You walk now in Thebes at your large,</p>
<p>And with my woe you are little charged.</p>
<p>You may, possessing wisdom and manhood,</p>
<p>Assemble all the folk among our kindred,</p>
<p>And start so fierce a war in this city</p>
<p>That by some venture, or some treaty,</p>
<p>You may have her to be your lady wife</p>
<p>For whose sake I must needs lose my life.</p>
<p>For, as regards the possibility,</p>
<p>Since you are now at large, of prison free,</p>
<p>And are a lord, great is your advantage,</p>
<p>More than mine who starve here in a cage.</p>
<p>For I must weep and wail while I live,</p>
<p>With all the woe that prison life may give,</p>
<p>And with the pain that love grants also,</p>
<p>That doubles my torment and my woe.’</p>
<p>With that he felt the fire of envy start</p>
<p>Within his breast, and seize him by the heart,</p>
<p>So furiously he like was to behold</p>
<p>As box-wood, pale, or ashes dead and cold.</p>
<p>Then said he: ‘O cruel goddess, that controls,</p>
<p>This world with your eternal words enfolds,</p>
<p>Engraving in your tables of adamant</p>
<p>The eternal destinies that you will grant,</p>
<p>What more is mankind to you of old</p>
<p>Than a flock of sheep cowering in a fold?</p>
<p>For man is slain as easily as any beast,</p>
<p>And dwells alike in prison, and is seized,</p>
<p>And suffers sickness, great adversity,</p>
<p>And often he is guiltless, indeed.</p>
<p>What justice is there in your prescience</p>
<p>That torments guiltless innocence?</p>
<p>And yet all my penance is increased:</p>
<p>For man is bound to do as he agreed,</p>
<p>For God’s sake, in curbing of his will,</p>
<p>Whereas a beast may all its lust fulfil.</p>
<p>And when a beast is dead it feels no pain,</p>
<p>But man after death must weep again,</p>
<p>Though in this world he had care and woe;</p>
<p>Without a doubt, things may happen so.</p>
<p>The answer to this I leave to the divines;</p>
<p>But well I know that in this world man pines.</p>
<p>Alas, I see a serpent or a thief,</p>
<p>That to many a man has done mischief,</p>
<p>Go where he wishes, and at will return,</p>
<p>But I must be imprisoned through Saturn,</p>
<p>And Juno, jealous and furious, who would</p>
<p>Destroy well nigh all the Theban blood,</p>
<p>And Thebes itself, its ruined walls spread wide,</p>
<p>While Venus slays me from the other side,</p>
<p>For jealousy and fear of Arcita.’</p>
<p>Now will I turn from Palamon and here</p>
<p>Leave him in his prison now to dwell,</p>
<p>And of Arcita on the instant tell.</p>
<p>The summer passes, and the nights long</p>
<p>Increase in double wise the pains strong,</p>
<p>Both of the lover and the prisoner.</p>
<p>I know not which of them is the sadder:</p>
<p>For briefly for to tell, this Palamon</p>
<p>Is damned perpetually to prison,</p>
<p>In chains and fetters to his final breath;</p>
<p>Arcita is banished, on pain of death,</p>
<p>Exiled for evermore from that country,</p>
<p>And nevermore his lady shall he see.</p>
<p>You lovers, now I ask of you this question:</p>
<p>Who suffers worst, Arcita or Palamon?</p>
<p>The one may see his lady day by day,</p>
<p>But in prison he must dwell always;</p>
<p>The other where he wishes ride or go,</p>
<p>But he shall see his lady nevermore.</p>
<p>Judge as it pleases you, who know and can,</p>
<p>For I will finish that which I began.</p>

<p>When that Arcita at Thebes arrived was,</p>
<p>All the day he languished, cried ‘alas!’</p>
<p>For he shall see his lady nevermore.</p>
<p>And briefly to conclude all his woe,</p>
<p>So much sorrow had never a creature</p>
<p>That is or shall be while the world endures.</p>
<p>Of sleep, of meat, of drink, he is bereft,</p>
<p>So that he waxes dry as a spear-shaft;</p>
<p>His eyes hollow and grisly to behold,</p>
<p>His hue sallow and pale as ashes cold.</p>
<p>And solitary he was and ever alone,</p>
<p>And wailing all the night, making his moan.</p>
<p>And if he heard a song or instrument,</p>
<p>Then he would weep, to infinite extent.</p>
<p>So feeble were his spirits and so low,</p>
<p>And changed so that no man might know</p>
<p>His speech, nor his voice, that they heard.</p>
<p>And in his manner for all the world he fared</p>
<p>As not only seized with lovers’ malady</p>
<p>Of heroes, rather with the lunacy</p>
<p>Engendered by a humour melancholic</p>
<p>Up top, in his cerebrum fantastic.</p>
<p>And briefly, was so turned upside-down</p>
<p>In body and disposition, foot to crown,</p>
<p>Of this woeful lover, Sir Arcita</p>
<p>Why write all day about his discomposure?</p>
<p>When he had endured two years or so</p>
<p>Of this cruel torment, this pain and woe,</p>
<p>At Thebes, in his own country, as I said,</p>
<p>Upon a night, asleep, and in his bed,</p>
<p>He thought he saw the winged god Mercury</p>
<p>Standing before him, bidding him be merry.</p>
<p>His wand of sleep he bore in hand upright;</p>
<p>A cap he wore upon his hair bright.</p>
<p>Arrayed was this god, remarked Arcita,</p>
<p>As he was when Argus was the sleeper;</p>
<p>And he said thus: ‘To Athens shall you wend,</p>
<p>There to your woe there is ordained an end.’</p>
<p>And these words woke Arcita with a start.</p>
<p>‘Now, truly, however much it pains my heart,’</p>
<p>Quoth he, ‘to Athens right now will I fare.</p>
<p>Not even for dread of death will I despair</p>
<p>But see my lady that I love and serve;</p>
<p>In her presence from death I shall not swerve.’</p>
<p>And with that word he seized a great mirror,</p>
<p>And saw in it that changed was all his colour,</p>
<p>And saw his visage all of another kind.</p>
<p>And right away it came into his mind</p>
<p>That, since his face was so disfigured</p>
<p>From the sickness that he had endured,</p>
<p>He might well if he kept a humble tone</p>
<p>Live in Athens evermore unknown,</p>
<p>And see his lady well nigh every day.</p>
<p>And so at once he changed his array,</p>
<p>And clad himself as does a labourer;</p>
<p>And all alone, save only for a squire</p>
<p>That knew his secrets and his cause,</p>
<p>And was disguised as humbly as he was,</p>
<p>To Athens is he gone the quickest way.</p>
<p>And to the court he went upon a day,</p>
<p>And at the gate offered his services,</p>
<p>To drudge and draw, whatever men thought best.</p>
<p>And briefly of this matter to explain,</p>
<p>He started work for a chamberlain,</p>
<p>The which was dwelling there with Emily,</p>
<p>For he was wise and swiftly could espy</p>
<p>The worth of every servant caught his eye.</p>
<p>Arcita could hew wood well and water bear,</p>
<p>For young and strong, appropriately grown,</p>
<p>He was tall too, and mighty in the bone</p>
<p>Fit for whatever any could devise.</p>
<p>A year or two he laboured in this wise,</p>
<p>Page of the chamber of Emily the bright,</p>
<p>And Philostrate he named himself aright.</p>
<p>And half so well-beloved a man as he</p>
<p>There never was at court, of his degree.</p>
<p>He was so noble in his low condition</p>
<p>That throughout the court ran his renown.</p>
<p>They said that it would be a charity</p>
<p>If Theseus were to heighten his degree,</p>
<p>And some nobler service then devise</p>
<p>Where he might his virtue exercise.</p>
<p>And thus in a while his name had sprung</p>
<p>To every lip, for deeds and courteous tongue,</p>
<p>So that Theseus advanced him higher</p>
<p>And of his chamber made him a squire,</p>
<p>And gave him gold to maintain his degree.</p>
<p>And men too brought him from his own country</p>
<p>Year by year, and secretly, his rent.</p>
<p>And secretly and honestly was it spent,</p>
<p>That no man wondered at what he had.</p>
<p>And three years in this wise this life he led,</p>
<p>And bore him so in peace and in war,</p>
<p>There was no man Theseus liked more.</p>
<p>And in this bliss I now will leave Arcita</p>
<p>And speak I will of Palamon the lover.  </p>
<p>In that dark and horribly strong prison,</p>
<p>This seven-year has lived our Palamon,</p>
<p>Pining away in sorrow and distress.</p>
<p>Who feels a double grief and heaviness</p>
<p>But Palamon whom love tortures so</p>
<p>That he is almost maddened by his woe?</p>
<p>And moreover he is a prisoner</p>
<p>Perpetually, and not just for a year.</p>
<p>Who could rhyme in English properly</p>
<p>His martyrdom? Truly, it is not I!</p>
<p>Therefore I pass on lightly as I may.</p>
<p>It fell that in the seventh year, of May</p>
<p>The third night (as the old books say</p>
<p>That tell this story in a fuller way),</p>
<p>Whether by chance or by destiny –</p>
<p>As when a thing happens it must be –</p>
<p>That soon after midnight, Palamon</p>
<p>Helped by a friend, broke from the prison,</p>
<p>And fled the city as fast as he could go.</p>
<p>For he had given his gaoler drink, so</p>
<p>Of a honeyed cup of a certain wine,</p>
<p>With narcotics and Theban opium fine,</p>
<p>That all night, though men did him shake,</p>
<p>The gaoler slept; and no man could him wake.</p>
<p>Thus Palamon flees as fast as ever he may.</p>
<p>The night was short and it was near to day,</p>
<p>So of necessity he must him hide.</p>
<p>And into a grove there close beside</p>
<p>With fearful foot stalked our Palamon.</p>
<p>For, briefly, it was his opinion</p>
<p>That in the grove he might hide all day,</p>
<p>And then in the night be on his way</p>
<p>Towards Thebes, his friends there to pray</p>
<p>To arm themselves and Theseus to assail.</p>
<p>And, briefly, either he would lose his life,</p>
<p>Or win Emily to be his wife.</p>
<p>This is the gist and his intention plain.</p>
<p>Now will I turn to Arcita again,</p>
<p>Who little knew how soon he must prepare</p>
<p>For fate, till Fortune caught him in her snare.</p>
<p>The busy lark, the messenger of day,</p>
<p>Salutes, with song, the morning grey,</p>
<p>And fiery Phoebus rises up so bright</p>
<p>That all the Orient laughs with light,</p>
<p>And with his rays falling on the trees</p>
<p>Dries the silver droplets on the leaves.</p>
<p>And Arcita, that in the court so royal</p>
<p>Of Theseus is a squire, the principal,</p>
<p>Has risen, and regards the cheerful day,</p>
<p>And to offer his observances to May,</p>
<p>Remembering the object of his desire,</p>
<p>He on a courser, quivering like fire,</p>
<p>Rides out into the fields in play,</p>
<p>Our of the court, a mile or two away;</p>
<p>And towards the grove of which I told</p>
<p>By chance his intention did unfold</p>
<p>To make a garland such as one weaves</p>
<p>Either of hawthorn or of woodbine leaves.</p>
<p>And loud he sung in the sunlit scene:</p>
<p>‘May, with all your flowers, so green,</p>
<p>Welcome to you, fairest freshest May,</p>
<p>In hopes that get some greenery I may.’</p>
<p>And from his courser, with a cheerful heart,</p>
<p>Into the grove full hastily, apart,</p>
<p>He entered, and there roamed up and down,</p>
<p>Where by that happenstance our Palamon</p>
<p>Was hiding in the bushes, that none might see,</p>
<p>For sore afraid of meeting death was he.</p>
<p>He had no way to know it was Arcita;</p>
<p>God knows he would have thought it any other!</p>
<p>But so is it said, and has been many a year,</p>
<p>‘The fields have eyes, and the woods have ears.’</p>
<p>A man should practise equanimity,</p>
<p>For in unexpected places men may meet.</p>
<p>Little, Arcita knew of his friend in hiding</p>
<p>So near to him he could hear him singing,</p>
<p>For among the bushes he sat, perfectly still.</p>
<p>When of roaming Arcita has had his fill,</p>
<p>And has sung all his roundel gaily,</p>
<p>Into a reverie he falls suddenly,</p>
<p>As these lovers do, with their strange desires –</p>
<p>Now in the tree-tops, now among the briars,</p>
<p>Now up, now down, like a bucket in a well;</p>
<p>Just like a Friday, if truth be to tell,</p>
<p>Shining one moment, and then raining fast.</p>
<p>So is changeable Venus overcast</p>
<p>In her folks’ hearts; and just as her day</p>
<p>Is changeable, so then is her array.</p>
<p>Seldom are Friday and other days alike.</p>
<p>When Arcita had sung, he began to sigh,</p>
<p>And sat himself down as if forlorn.</p>
<p>‘Alas’, quoth he, ‘the day that I was born!’</p>
<p>How long, Juno, in your cruelty</p>
<p>Will you make war against Thebes’ city?</p>
<p>Alas, all things are brought to confusion</p>
<p>The royal blood of Cadmus and Amphion –</p>
<p>Of Cadmus, who was indeed the first man</p>
<p>To build at Thebes, and that town began,</p>
<p>And of that city was first crowned king.</p>
<p>Of his lineage am I, and his offspring,</p>
<p>By true line, and of the blood royal.</p>
<p>And now I am so slavish and in thrall</p>
<p>That he that is my mortal enemy</p>
<p>I serve him as his squire, all humbly.</p>
<p>Yet Juno does me a greater shame,</p>
<p>I dare not acknowledge my own name;</p>
<p>And where I once was Arcita by right,</p>
<p>Now I am Philostrate, not worth a mite.</p>
<p>Alas, you cruel Mars, alas Juno!</p>
<p>Thus has your anger shorn our lineage so,</p>
<p>Save only me and wretched Palamon,</p>
<p>Whom Theseus martyrs in his prison.</p>
<p>After all this, to slay me utterly,</p>
<p>Love has his fiery dart so burningly</p>
<p>Thrust through my true sorrowful heart,</p>
<p>That my death was shaped from the start.</p>
<p>Emily, you have slain me with your eye!</p>
<p>You are the reason that I have to die.</p>
<p>On all of the rest of my other cares</p>
<p>I’d set not the value of a heap of tares,</p>
<p>If I could only please you by some chance.’</p>
<p>And with these words he fell down in a trance</p>
<p>For a length of time, then gave a start.</p>
<p>Now Palamon, who thought that through his heart</p>
<p>He felt a cold sword suddenly glide,</p>
<p>Shook with anger; no longer would he hide.</p>
<p>And when he had heard Arcita’s tale,</p>
<p>As if he were mad, face deathly pale,</p>
<p>He started up out of the bushy thicket,</p>
<p>And cried: ‘Arcita, traitor false and wicked!</p>
<p>Now you are trapped, who love my lady so,</p>
<p>For whom I suffer all this pain and woe,</p>
<p>Who are of my blood, my friend or so you swore,</p>
<p>As I have told you many times before,</p>
<p>And here you have tricked Duke Theseus,</p>
<p>Falsely concealed your true name thus!</p>
<p>You will be killed, or else kill me;</p>
<p>You shall not have my lady Emily,</p>
<p>I alone will love her, no other so.</p>
<p>For I am Palamon, your, mortal foe,</p>
<p>And though I have no weapon in this place,</p>
<p>But out of prison am escaped by grace,</p>
<p>I doubt not you will be slain by me,</p>
<p>Or else forgo the love of Emily.</p>
<p>Choose as you will, you shall not depart!’</p>
<p>Then Arcita with a scornful heart,</p>
<p>When he knew him, and his tale had heard,</p>
<p>As fierce as a lion pulled out his sword</p>
<p>And said thus: ‘By God that sits above,</p>
<p>Were it not you are sick and mad with love,</p>
<p>And have no weapon too in this place,</p>
<p>You would never out of this grove pace</p>
<p>Without you meeting death at my hand.</p>
<p>For I defy the pledge, and the bond</p>
<p>Which you say I have made with thee.</p>
<p>Fool that you are, bethink you, love is free,</p>
<p>And I will love her, despite all your might!</p>
<p>But inasmuch as you are a noble knight,</p>
<p>And willing to lay claim to her in battle,</p>
<p>Hear my word: tomorrow I will not fail,</p>
<p>For, without telling any man this night,</p>
<p>Here then I will be found, a true knight,</p>
<p>And I will bring armour enough for thee,</p>
<p>Choose you the best, and leave the worst for me.</p>
<p>And meat and drink this night will bring,</p>
<p>Enough for you, and clothes for bedding.</p>
<p>And if so happen that you my lady win</p>
<p>And slay me in this wood that I am in,</p>
<p>Then is the lady yours, if so it be.’</p>
<p>Then Palamon answered: ‘I agree.’</p>
<p>And thus they parted till the morrow,</p>
<p>For each had pledged his word, I vow. </p>
<p>O Cupid, lacking in all charity!</p>
<p>O power that will share no sovereignty!</p>
<p>Truly is it said that love and lordship</p>
<p>Will not willingly brook fellowship;</p>
<p>Well known to Arcita and Palemon.</p>
<p>Arcita rode away towards the town;</p>
<p>And on the morrow, in the dawning light,</p>
<p>Two suits of armour readied for the fight,</p>
<p>Both sufficient and fitting to maintain</p>
<p>The battle in the field between the twain.</p>
<p>And on his horse, alone, as he was born,</p>
<p>He bore the weight of armour in the dawn.</p>
<p>And in the grove, at time and place as set,</p>
<p>This Arcita and Palamon were met.</p>
<p>A change had overtaken each man’s face,</p>
<p>Just like a hunter in the realms of Thrace,</p>
<p>Who stands out in the open with a spear,</p>
<p>When on a hunt for lion or for bear,</p>
<p>And hears the beast come rushing through the trees,</p>
<p>Breaking all the branches and the leaves,</p>
<p>Thinks: ‘Here comes my mortal enemy!</p>
<p>Without fail he must die, or death for me;</p>
<p>For either I must slay him in this gap,</p>
<p>Or he slays me if I should meet mishap.’</p>
<p>So both their complexions changed in hue.</p>
<p>As each of them his bold opponent knew,</p>
<p>There was no ‘good day’, no other greeting,</p>
<p>But straight away without word or rehearsing,</p>
<p>Each of them began to arm the other,</p>
<p>In as friendly a way as if it were his brother;</p>
<p>And after that with spears sharp and strong</p>
<p>They thrust at each other, wondrous long.</p>
<p>You would have thought that Palamon</p>
<p>In battle was indeed a raging lion,</p>
<p>A cruel tiger Arcita in the fight.</p>
<p>Like two wild boars that fiercely smite,</p>
<p>Frothing white with foam in angry mood;</p>
<p>Up to the ankles they fought in blood.</p>
<p>And in this guise I leaving them fighting well,</p>
<p>And once again of Theseus I will tell.</p>
<p>Destiny, that Minister-General,</p>
<p>Who executes on earth, over all,</p>
<p>The Providence that God saw long before,</p>
<p>Has such power that though all men swore</p>
<p>The contrary of a thing by yea or nay,</p>
<p>Yet there will come to pass upon a day</p>
<p>What will not happen in a thousand years.</p>
<p>For certainly our appetites down here,</p>
<p>Be they for war, or peace, hate or love,</p>
<p>All are ruled by the vision that’s above.</p>
<p>This will explain why mighty Theseus,</p>
<p>Of hunting is so deeply desirous</p>
<p>And to chase the great stag in May,</p>
<p>That about his bed there dawns no day</p>
<p>When he’s not clad and ready for the ride,</p>
<p>With huntsman, horn, and hounds at his side.</p>
<p>For in his hunting he takes such delight</p>
<p>That it is all his joy and appetite</p>
<p>To be himself the great stag’s bane;</p>
<p>For after Mars he serves Diana’s name.</p>
<p>Clear was the day, as I have told ere this,</p>
<p>And Theseus, full of joy and bliss</p>
<p>With his Hippolyta, the fair queen,</p>
<p>And Emily, clothed all in green,</p>
<p>Off to the hunt went riding royally.</p>
<p>And to the grove that stood close nearby,</p>
<p>In which there was a stag, so it was told,</p>
<p>Duke Theseus the nearest way he rode,</p>
<p>And to the clearing made his way outright,</p>
<p>For thither the stag would take his flight,</p>
<p>And over a brook, and so forth on his way.</p>
<p>The Duke will try a course or two today,</p>
<p>With hounds singled out at his command.</p>
<p>And when the Duke reached the open land,</p>
<p>Under the sun he gazed, and at once</p>
<p>Was aware of Arcita and Palamon,</p>
<p>Fighting like a pair of bulls, they go.</p>
<p>The bright swords flickered to and fro,</p>
<p>So hideously, that the slightest stroke</p>
<p>Seemed powerful enough to fell an oak.</p>
<p>But who they were, he could not know.</p>
<p>The Duke his courser with his spurs smote,</p>
<p>And in an instant was between the two,</p>
<p>And pulled out his sword, crying: ‘Ho!</p>
<p>No more, punishment be on your heads!</p>
<p>By mighty Mars, he shall soon be dead</p>
<p>That smites one stroke that I shall see.</p>
<p>But tell me what kind of men you be,</p>
<p>Who are so bold to combat here</p>
<p>Without a judge or other officer,</p>
<p>As if you were in the lists, royally.’</p>
<p>The Palamon answered him speedily</p>
<p>And said, ‘Sire, what more need words do?</p>
<p>Death we have deserved, both we two.</p>
<p>Two woeful wretches we, two captives,</p>
<p>That are burdened by our lives;</p>
<p>And as you are our rightful lord and judge,</p>
<p>Then show us neither mercy nor refuge;</p>
<p>But slay me first, for holy charity!</p>
<p>Then slay my fellow too, as well as me –</p>
<p>Or slay him first; though you do not know</p>
<p>This is Arcita, this your mortal foe,</p>
<p>Banished from your land, be it on his head,</p>
<p>For which alone he deserves to be dead.</p>
<p>For this is he who came to your gate,</p>
<p>And said that he was named Philostrate.</p>
<p>So has he deceived you many a year,</p>
<p>Yet you have made him your chief squire.</p>
<p>And this is he that loves Emily.</p>
<p>For since my death-day is come to me,</p>
<p>I make fully my confession</p>
<p>That I am that woeful Palamon</p>
<p>That broke from your prison wickedly.</p>
<p>I am your mortal foe, and it is I</p>
<p>Who love with passion Emily the bright,</p>
<p>That I would die this instant in her sight.</p>
<p>Therefore I ask for judgement and to die.</p>
<p>But slay my fellow in the same wise,</p>
<p>For we have both deserved to be slain.’</p>
<p>The noble Duke then answered them again</p>
<p>And said: ‘This is a brief conclusion!</p>
<p>Your own mouth, by your own confession,</p>
<p>Has condemned you, so I shall record.</p>
<p>There is no need for torture with the cord!</p>
<p>You shall die, by mighty Mars the red!’</p>
<p>At once the Queen, for very womanliness,</p>
<p>Began to weep, and so did Emily,</p>
<p>And all the ladies in their company.</p>
<p>Great pity was it, as they thought them all,</p>
<p>That ever such a mishap should befall,</p>
<p>For they were noblemen, of great estate,</p>
<p>And over love alone was this debate;</p>
<p>And saw their bloody wounds wide and sore,</p>
<p>And all cried out, both less and more,</p>
<p>‘Have mercy, lord, upon us women all!’</p>
<p>And on their bare knees they did fall,</p>
<p>And would have kissed his feet where he stood;</p>
<p>Till finally their weeping calmed his mood,</p>
<p>For pity is quick to rise in noble heart.</p>
<p>And though he shook with anger at the start,</p>
<p>He had considered swiftly, in a pause,</p>
<p>Their mutual trespass, and its cause,</p>
<p>And though his anger saw them both accused,</p>
<p>Yet with his reason he had both excused,</p>
<p>As thus: he well knew that every man</p>
<p>Will help himself to love if he can,</p>
<p>And also deliver himself from prison;</p>
<p>And then his heart filled with compassion</p>
<p>For women, for they weep ever as one:</p>
<p>And in his noble heart he thought anon,</p>
<p>And soft to himself he said: ‘Fie</p>
<p>Upon a lord that sees his mercy die,</p>
<p>But is a lion, both in word and deed,</p>
<p>To him that repents and is in dread</p>
<p>As much as to a proud and haughty man,</p>
<p>Who will maintain what he at first began.</p>
<p>That lord has little true discretion</p>
<p>That twixt cases makes no distinction,</p>
<p>But weighs pride and humility as one.’</p>
<p>And soon as, thus, his anger had gone,</p>
<p>He began to look up, his eyes alight,</p>
<p>And spoke these words, as from a height:</p>
<p>‘The God of Love, ah, Benedicite!</p>
<p>How mighty and how great a lord, I say!</p>
<p>Against his might there stand no obstacles.</p>
<p>He may be called a god by his miracles,</p>
<p>For he can make, as seems good in his eyes,</p>
<p>Of every heart whatever he might devise.</p>
<p>Lo, here is this Arcita, this Palamon,</p>
<p>That had their freedom from my prison,</p>
<p>And might have lived in Thebes royally,</p>
<p>And know I am their mortal enemy,</p>
<p>And that their death lies in my power too,</p>
<p>And yet has Love, despite their eyes two,</p>
<p>Brought them both hither for to die!</p>
<p>Now see, is that not surely folly’s height?</p>
<p>Who is not a fool when he’s in love?</p>
<p>Behold, for God’s sake who sits above,</p>
<p>See how they bleed! Be they not well arrayed?</p>
<p>Thus has their lord, the God of Love, repaid</p>
<p>With such fees, their service that he buys!</p>
<p>And yet they proclaim themselves so wise</p>
<p>They that serve Love, whatever may befall.</p>
<p>But here is yet the best game of all,</p>
<p>That she for whom they play this lunacy,</p>
<p>Has no more cause to thank them than me!</p>
<p>She knows no more of all this hot affair,</p>
<p>By God, than does a cuckoo or a hare!</p>
<p>But all must be attempted, hot or cold;</p>
<p>A man must play the fool, young or old.</p>
<p>I know it of myself, in years now gone,</p>
<p>For in my time a servant I made one.</p>
<p>And therefore, since I know love’s pain,</p>
<p>And how fierce the heart it can constrain,</p>
<p>As one who has been in the net, alas,</p>
<p>I forgive you wholly this trespass.</p>
<p>At the Queen’s request who kneels here,</p>
<p>And for Emily too, my sister dear.</p>
<p>And you at once shall both to me swear</p>
<p>Never to harm my country, nor to war</p>
<p>Against me, whether by night or day,</p>
<p>But being friends to me, in all you may,</p>
<p>I forgive you this trespass that befell.’</p>
<p>They swore as he requested fair and well,</p>
<p>And him for lordship and for mercy prayed;</p>
<p>And he granted them grace, and thus he said:</p>
<p>‘In terms of royal lineages and riches,</p>
<p>Though she were a queen or a princess,</p>
<p>Each of the two of you is worthy, doubtless,</p>
<p>To wed in due time; yet nevertheless –</p>
<p>I speak as for my sister Emily,</p>
<p>The reason for your strife and jealousy –</p>
<p>You know yourself she cannot wed both</p>
<p>At once, though you fight forever so.</p>
<p>That one of you, regardless of joy or grief,</p>
<p>Must go play tunes upon an ivy-leaf.</p>
<p>That is to say, she cannot now have both,</p>
<p>However jealous you be, or wrath.</p>
<p>And therefore I put it to you simply,</p>
<p>That each of you shall seek his destiny</p>
<p>As it is written, and listen in what wise;</p>
<p>Lo here, your end, I shall now devise.</p>
<p>My will is this, to bring all to conclusion,</p>
<p>Without any kind of protestation –</p>
<p>If you agree, accept it for the best:</p>
<p>Each of you go where fate suggests,</p>
<p>Freely without ransom or danger,</p>
<p>And this day fifty weeks, no later,</p>
<p>Each of you shall bring a hundred knights,</p>
<p>Armed for the lists, prepared to fight,</p>
<p>Ready to lay claim to her in battle.</p>
<p>And this I promise you, without fail,</p>
<p>Upon my truth, and as I am a knight,</p>
<p>That whichever of you both has might –</p>
<p>That is to say whether him or thou –</p>
<p>May with his hundred, that I spoke of now,</p>
<p>Slay his foe, or from the lists him drive,</p>
<p>Then shall he have Emily to wife</p>
<p>To whom Fortune gave so fair a grace.</p>
<p>The tourney I will hold in this place;</p>
<p>And God have mercy on my soul too</p>
<p>If I am not a fair judge and true!</p>
<p>No other agreement shall we make then</p>
<p>But that one of you be dead or taken.</p>
<p>And if you think this all well said,</p>
<p>Be you content, and bow your head.</p>
<p>This is your end and your conclusion.’</p>
<p>Who looks cheerfully now but Palamon?</p>
<p>Who leaps up for joy but Arcita?</p>
<p>Who could tell or who could write here,</p>
<p>The joy that is revealed in that place,</p>
<p>Where Theseus has shown so fair a grace?</p>
<p>But down on their knees fell all in sight,</p>
<p>And thanked him with all their heart and might,</p>
<p>And especially the Thebans time on time.</p>
<p>And so with good hope, and hearts blithe,</p>
<p>They take their leave and homeward they ride</p>
<p>To Thebes with its walls old and wide.</p>

<p>I know men would deem it negligence</p>
<p>If I forgot to tell of the expense</p>
<p>To Theseus, who goes so busily</p>
<p>To construct the lists royally,</p>
<p>That such a noble theatre it was,</p>
<p>I dare well say, as this world has.</p>
<p>The circuit a mile was about,</p>
<p>Walled with stone and ditched without.</p>
<p>Its shape was round, in manner of a compass,</p>
<p>Tier on tier, the height of sixty paces,</p>
<p>So that when a man was in his seat</p>
<p>The fellow sat above him still could see.</p>
<p>Eastward there stood a gate of marble white;</p>
<p>Westward another opposite upright.</p>
<p>And briefly to conclude, such a place</p>
<p>Was never on earth in so small a space.</p>
<p>For in the land was never a craftsman</p>
<p>No geometer, or arithmetician,</p>
<p>No painter or carver of images,</p>
<p>That Theseus gave not meat and wages</p>
<p>To create his theatre and devise,</p>
<p>And to observe his rite and sacrifice,</p>
<p>Eastward he had upon the gate above,</p>
<p>To worship Venus, Goddess of love,</p>
<p>Made an altar and an oratory;</p>
<p>And on the westward gate in memory</p>
<p>Of Mars, had made such another,</p>
<p>That cost a heap of gold, moreover.</p>
<p>And northward in a turret on the wall,</p>
<p>Of alabaster white and red coral</p>
<p>An oratory, rich indeed to see,</p>
<p>In worship of Diana of Chastity,</p>
<p>Theseus had wrought, in noble wise,</p>
<p>But yet have I forgotten to describe</p>
<p>The noble carving and the portraitures,</p>
<p>The shape, the countenance, and the figures</p>
<p>That adorned these oratories three.</p>
<p>First in the Temple of Venus, you might see,</p>
<p>Wrought on the wall, pitiful to behold,</p>
<p>The broken sleep, and sighs so cold,</p>
<p>The sacred tears, and the lamenting,</p>
<p>The fiery strokes of fond desiring</p>
<p>That Love’s servants in this life endure;</p>
<p>The oaths that their covenants assure,</p>
<p>Pleasure and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,</p>
<p>Beauty and Youth, Riches and Joyfulness,</p>
<p>Charms and Force, Deceit and Flattery,</p>
<p>Extravagance, Intrigue, and Jealousy,</p>
<p>That wore of yellow gold a garland,</p>
<p>And a cuckoo sitting on their hand,</p>
<p>Feasts, and instruments, choirs and dance,</p>
<p>Lust and adornment, all the circumstance</p>
<p>Of Love, that I relate and shall, all</p>
<p>By order were portrayed on the wall,</p>
<p>And more of them than I can mention.</p>
<p>For in truth, all the Mount of Cithaeron,</p>
<p>Where Venus has her principal dwelling,</p>
<p>Was shown on the wall in the painting,</p>
<p>With all her garden and its joyfulness.</p>
<p>Nor was forgot the gateman, Idleness,</p>
<p>Nor Narcissus the fair, of times long gone,</p>
<p>Nor yet the folly of King Solomon,</p>
<p>Nor yet the mighty strength of Hercules,</p>
<p>Those enchantments of Medea, and Circe’s,</p>
<p>Nor Turnus with courage fierce and hardy,</p>
<p>Rich Croesus, wretched in slavery.</p>
<p>Thus may you see no wisdom or riches,</p>
<p>Beauty or skill, strength or boldness,</p>
<p>May with Venus contend successfully,</p>
<p>For, as she wishes, so the world rules she.</p>
<p>Lo, all these folk into her net so passed,</p>
<p>That they for woe often cried ‘alas!’</p>
<p>Suffice it these examples, one or two,</p>
<p>Though I could cite another thousand too.</p>
<p>The statue of Venus glorious to see,</p>
<p>Was naked, floating in the open sea,</p>
<p>And from the navel down all covered was</p>
<p>With waves green and bright as any glass.</p>
<p>A cithern in her right hand held she,</p>
<p>And on her head, full seemly for to see,</p>
<p>A rose garland, fresh and sweet smelling;</p>
<p>Above her head her doves flickering.</p>
<p>Before her stood her son Cupid too,</p>
<p>Upon his shoulders wings had he two,</p>
<p>And blind he was, as is often seen;</p>
<p>A bow he held and arrows bright and keen.</p>
<p>Why should I not as well tell you all</p>
<p>The portraiture appearing on the wall</p>
<p>Within the temple of mighty Mars the red?</p>
<p>All painted was the wall in length and breadth,</p>
<p>Like the recesses of that grisly place</p>
<p>They call the great temple of Mars in Thrace,</p>
<p>In that cold and frosty region</p>
<p>Where Mars has his sovereign mansion.</p>
<p>First on the wall was painted a forest,</p>
<p>In which there dwells nor man nor beast,</p>
<p>With knotty gnarled barren trees old,</p>
<p>Jagged stumps, and hideous to behold,</p>
<p>Through which there ran a roaring and a sigh</p>
<p>As if bough-breaking winds were passing by.</p>
<p>And down beneath a hilly grassed descent,</p>
<p>There stood the temple of Mars omnipotent</p>
<p>In war, wrought all of burnished steel, the gate</p>
<p>Was ghastly for to see, and long and straight.</p>
<p>And from it came a blast of wind, a quake</p>
<p>That made all the portal seem to shake.</p>
<p>The northern light in at the doors shone,</p>
<p>For window in the walls was there none</p>
<p>Through which men might any light discern.</p>
<p>The door was all of adamant eterne,</p>
<p>Riveted crosswise and along</p>
<p>With iron tough, and to make it strong,</p>
<p>Every pillar, to sustain the shrine</p>
<p>Thick as a barrel, of iron bright and fine. </p>
<p>There saw I first the dark imagining</p>
<p>Of felony, and all its deep conspiring;</p>
<p>Cruel Anger, glowing fierce and red,</p>
<p>The pick-purse, and after him pale Dread;</p>
<p>The smiler with the knife under his cloak;</p>
<p>The cattle-shed burning in black smoke;</p>
<p>Treason, and the murdering in bed;</p>
<p>Open war with wounds that sadly bled;</p>
<p>Contest with bloody knife and sharp Menace;</p>
<p>All filled with creaking was that sorry place.</p>
<p>The slayer of himself yet saw I there</p>
<p>His heart’s blood had bathed all his hair;</p>
<p>The nail in the forehead in the night;</p>
<p>The cold death, with mouth gaping wide.</p>
<p>In the midst of the temple sat Mischance,</p>
<p>With comfortless and sorry countenance.</p>
<p>Yet saw I Madness cackling in his rage,</p>
<p>Armed Clamour, Outcry, and fierce Outrage.</p>
<p>The corpse in the bushes, with cut throat;</p>
<p>A thousand slain, and not by plague I note;</p>
<p>The tyrant with his prey by force bereft;</p>
<p>The town destroyed – there was nothing left.</p>
<p>Yet saw I burnt the dancing ships, and there</p>
<p>The hunter choked to death by wild bears;</p>
<p>The sow gnawing the child in the cradle;</p>
<p>The cook all scalded spite of his long ladle.</p>
<p>Naught was forgot, by influence of Mars,</p>
<p>The carter over-ridden by his cart;</p>
<p>Who beneath the wheel lay dying,</p>
<p>There were also of Mars’ devising</p>
<p>The barber, the butcher, the smith who will</p>
<p>Forge you a sharp sword on his anvil.</p>
<p>And all above, depicted on a tower,</p>
<p>Saw I Conquest, seated in great honour,</p>
<p>With the sharp sword above his head</p>
<p>Hanging by a fine and subtle thread.</p>
<p>Depicted was the slaughter of Julius,</p>
<p>Of Nero and Marcus Antonius;</p>
<p>Though in those days they were still unborn,</p>
<p>Yet was their death depicted long before,</p>
<p>By menacing Mars in stars yet to configure.</p>
<p>So was it shown there in that portraiture,</p>
<p>As is revealed in the heavens above,</p>
<p>Who shall be slain, or else die of love.</p>
<p>Let one example do from stories old;</p>
<p>I cannot reckon all that might be told.</p>
<p>The statue of Mars upon a chariot stood,</p>
<p>Armed and grim, as he were mad enough,</p>
<p>And over his head there shone two figures</p>
<p>Of Geomancy, named in sundry scriptures</p>
<p>The one Puella, the other Rubeus.</p>
<p>This god of weapons was arrayed thus:</p>
<p>A wolf there stood before him at his feet,</p>
<p>With red eyes, and of a man he ate.</p>
<p>With subtle pencil was drawn all the story</p>
<p>In reverence to Mars and his glory.</p>
<p>Now to the temple of Diana chaste</p>
<p>As swiftly as I can I will make haste,</p>
<p>To give you all of the description.</p>
<p>Painted were the walls, up and down,</p>
<p>With hunting and shame-faced chastity.</p>
<p>There saw I how sad Callisto came to be,</p>
<p>When Diana was aggrieved with her,</p>
<p>Transformed from a woman to a bear,</p>
<p>And after turned into the polar stars.</p>
<p>Thus was it painted; I can tell no more.</p>
<p>Her son’s in the stars too, as men may see.</p>
<p>There I saw Daphne turned into a tree;</p>
<p>I mean not the goddess, Diane, to name,</p>
<p>But Peneus’ daughter, Daphne, the same.</p>
<p>There I saw Actaeon a stag created,</p>
<p>In punishment for seeing Diane naked.</p>
<p>I saw how his hounds Actaeon caught,</p>
<p>And devoured him when they knew him not.</p>
<p>Yet painted further on, a little more,</p>
<p>How Atalanta hunted the wild boar,</p>
<p>And Meleager, and many a man also,</p>
<p>For which Diana wrought him care and woe.</p>
<p>There saw I many a wondrous story,</p>
<p>Which I care not to recall to memory.</p>
<p>This goddess high on a stag did sit,</p>
<p>With slender hounds all about her feet,</p>
<p>And underneath her feet there was a moon;</p>
<p>Waxing it was and would be waning soon.</p>
<p>In yellow-green her statue clothed was,</p>
<p>With bow in hand, and arrows in a case,</p>
<p>Her eyes, as she rode, she cast down,</p>
<p>To where Pluto has his dark region.</p>
<p>A woman in travail lay on the ground;</p>
<p>And because her child was not yet born,</p>
<p>Full pitifully on Lucina she did call,</p>
<p>Crying: ‘Help, for you can, best of all!’</p>
<p>He could paint to the life, that it wrought,</p>
<p>With many a florin he the colours bought.</p>
<p>Now the lists were made, and Theseus</p>
<p>Who at his great cost had created thus</p>
<p>The temples and the theatre, as I tell,</p>
<p>When it was done, liked it wondrous well.</p>
<p>But Theseus I will speak of later,</p>
<p>And pass to Palamon and Arcita.</p>
<p>The day approached for their returning,</p>
<p>When each a hundred knights should bring,</p>
<p>To fight their claim in battle, as I told,</p>
<p>And to Athens, their promise to uphold,</p>
<p>Each has brought with him a hundred knights,</p>
<p>Well armed for war and to maintain the right.</p>
<p>And assuredly it seemed to many a man</p>
<p>That never, since the world itself began,</p>
<p>In respect of fighting hand to hand,</p>
<p>As wide as God had made the sea and land,</p>
<p>Never so few made such true company.</p>
<p>For every fellow that loved chivalry,</p>
<p>And wished for more than a passing name,</p>
<p>Prayed he also might be of the game,</p>
<p>And fortunate for him that chosen was.</p>
<p>For if today there befell such a case,</p>
<p>You well know that every splendid knight</p>
<p>That loves his paramour, and is fit to fight,</p>
<p>Were it in England or indeed elsewhere,</p>
<p>He would be glad and eager to be there.</p>
<p>To fight for a lady, Benedicite!</p>
<p>That’s a fine sight to see, on any day.</p>
<p>And so indeed it fared with Palamon.</p>
<p>With him went there knights many a one:</p>
<p>Some chose to be armed in coats of mail,</p>
<p>Worn with a breastplate and a surcoat frail,</p>
<p>While some their suits of plate armour filled,</p>
<p>And some chose bucklers or a Prussian shield,</p>
<p>Some wanted armour on their legs as well</p>
<p>Wielding an axe, and some a mace of steel.</p>
<p>There is no fashion new that is not old!</p>
<p>Armed they were indeed as I have told,</p>
<p>Every man after his own opinion.</p>
<p>There might you have seen with Palamon,</p>
<p>Lycurgus himself, the great King of Thrace.</p>
<p>Black was his beard and manly was his face.</p>
<p>The circles of the eyes set in his head,</p>
<p>Glowed between a yellow and a red,</p>
<p>And like a griffon he gazed round about,</p>
<p>With shaggy hair on his bushy brows.</p>
<p>His limbs were vast, his muscles hard and strong,</p>
<p>His shoulders broad, his arms round and long.</p>
<p>And as the custom was in his country</p>
<p>High on a chariot of gold stood he,</p>
<p>With four white bulls in the traces.</p>
<p>Instead of coat-armour over his harness,</p>
<p>Yellow with nails and bright as any gold,</p>
<p>He had a bear-skin, old and black as coal.</p>
<p>His long hair was combed behind his back;</p>
<p>As any raven’s feather it shone black.</p>
<p>A wreath of gold, thick, and of great weight,</p>
<p>Upon his head sat, full of stones bright,</p>
<p>Of fine rubies and of diamonds.</p>
<p>About his chariot ran snow-white hounds,</p>
<p>Twenty or more, as big as any steer,</p>
<p>To chase after lions or the deer,</p>
<p>And followed him with muzzles tightly bound,</p>
<p>Collared in gold, with leash-rings around.</p>
<p>A hundred lords had he in his rout,</p>
<p>Fully armed, with hearts both stern and stout.</p>
<p>With Arcita, in story as men find,</p>
<p>The great Emetrius, the King of Inde,</p>
<p>On a bay steed, with trappings of steel,</p>
<p>And cloth of golden weave, haunch to heel,</p>
<p>Came Mars, like the god of weaponry</p>
<p>His surcoat was of cloth of Tartary,</p>
<p>Adorned with pearls, white, round and bold.</p>
<p>His saddle of pure freshly-beaten gold,</p>
<p>A short mantle on his shoulder hanging,</p>
<p>Dense with rubies red, like fire sparkling.</p>
<p>His crisp hair in clustered ringlets done,</p>
<p>And that was yellow, glittering like the sun.</p>
<p>Aquiline nose, his ochreous eyes glowing,</p>
<p>His lips were full, his colour was sanguine.</p>
<p>Some scattered freckles on his face, too</p>
<p>Betwixt black and yellow in their hue,</p>
<p>And like a lion he cast his gaze around.</p>
<p>Of five and twenty years his age, I vow.</p>
<p>His beard had made a good beginning;</p>
<p>His voice was like a trumpet thundering.</p>
<p>Upon his head he wore, of laurel green,</p>
<p>A garland fresh and pleasant to be seen.</p>
<p>Upon his hand he bore for his delight</p>
<p>An eagle tame, as any lily white.</p>
<p>A hundred lords he had with him there,</p>
<p>Armoured, save their heads, in all their gear,</p>
<p>Full richly in every manner of things.</p>
<p>For be assured, that dukes, earls, kings,</p>
<p>Were gathered in that noble company,</p>
<p>For love and in support of chivalry.</p>
<p>About this king there ran on every side</p>
<p>Many a lion and leopard in their pride.</p>
<p>And in this wise these lords, all and one,</p>
<p>Are on this Sunday to the city come,</p>
<p>At nine about, and in the town alight,</p>
<p>This Theseus, this Duke, this noble knight,</p>
<p>When he had led them into his city,</p>
<p>And housed them, in accord with their degree,</p>
<p>Feasted them, and applied so much labour</p>
<p>To entertaining them, doing them honour,</p>
<p>That men still think and say that no man’s wit</p>
<p>However great could ever have bettered it.</p>
<p>The minstrelsy, the service at the feast,</p>
<p>The great gifts to the highest and least,</p>
<p>The rich adornment of Theseus’ palace</p>
<p>Nor who sat first or last on the dais,</p>
<p>Which ladies fairest, or best at dancing,</p>
<p>Or which of them could best chant and sing,</p>
<p>Nor which could speak most feelingly of love,</p>
<p>What hawks were sitting on the perch above,</p>
<p>What hounds were lying on the ground –</p>
<p>Of all of this I make no mention now,</p>
<p>But all that came of it; that thinks me best.</p>
<p>Now here’s the point, hearken if you wish.</p>
<p>That Sunday night ere day began to spring,</p>
<p>When Palamon the lark heard sing –</p>
<p>Though it was not yet day an hour or two</p>
<p>Yet sung the lark – and Palamon then flew,</p>
<p>With holy heart and with noble courage,</p>
<p>Rising at once to make his pilgrimage</p>
<p>To blissful Citherea the benign;</p>
<p>Venus I mean, honourable and divine.</p>
<p>And in her hour he walked out apace,</p>
<p>Towards the lists where her temple was,</p>
<p>And down he knelt, and humble did appear,</p>
<p>With sore heart, he spoke as you shall hear:</p>
<p>‘Fairest of Fair, O my lady Venus,</p>
<p>Daughter to Jove and spouse to Vulcanus,</p>
<p>Who gladden Cithaeron’s summit,</p>
<p>By that love you showed Adonis,</p>
<p>Have pity on my bitter tears’ smart,</p>
<p>And take my humble prayer to heart.</p>
<p>Alas, I neither language have to tell</p>
<p>Of the effects, nor torments of my hell,</p>
<p>My heart may my hurt not display;</p>
<p>I am so confused what can I say</p>
<p>But ‘Mercy, lady bright, who know indeed</p>
<p>My thoughts, and can see the hurt I feel!’</p>
<p>Consider all this, and pity me the more,</p>
<p>As surely as I shall, for evermore,</p>
<p>With all my power, your true servant be,</p>
<p>And evermore make war on chastity.’</p>
<p>This I vow, so long as you help me!</p>
<p>I wield not my weapons boastfully,</p>
<p>Nor do I ask tomorrow’s victory,</p>
<p>Nor for renown, nor for the vain glory</p>
<p>Of skill in arms proclaimed up and down;</p>
<p>But I would have complete possession</p>
<p>Of Emily, and die in your service.</p>
<p>Choose you the manner how, in what guise,</p>
<p>I care not, whether it better be,</p>
<p>To have victory of them or they of me,</p>
<p>If I but have my lady in my arms.</p>
<p>For though it be that Mars is god of arms,</p>
<p>Your power is so great in heaven above,</p>
<p>That if you wish it, I shall have my love.</p>
<p>At your temple I will worship evermore so,</p>
<p>And on your altars, wherever I ride or go,</p>
<p>I will make sacrifice, light fires at their feet.</p>
<p>And if you will not so, my lady sweet,</p>
<p>Then pray I that tomorrow with a spear</p>
<p>This Arcita may through my heart pierce.</p>
<p>Then care I not, when I have lost my life,</p>
<p>That Arcita may win her as his wife.</p>
<p>This is the aim and end of my prayer:</p>
<p>Give me my love, you blessed lady dear!’</p>
<p>When Palamon had made his orison,</p>
<p>His sacrifice he made, and that anon,</p>
<p>Devoutly and with a full observance,</p>
<p>Though I tell not now all the circumstance.</p>
<p>Yet at the last the statue of Venus shook</p>
<p>And gave a sign, from which event he took</p>
<p>Heart that his prayer accepted was that day.</p>
<p>For though the sign revealed some delay,</p>
<p>Yet well he knew that granted was his boon,</p>
<p>And with glad heart he went him home full soon.</p>
<p>In the third hour after Palamon</p>
<p>To Venus’ temple had upped and gone,</p>
<p>Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily,</p>
<p>Off to the temple of Diana she.</p>
<p>The maidens that she thither with her led,</p>
<p>Were all prepared for fires to be fed,</p>
<p>Took incense, hangings, and the rest, all</p>
<p>That to sacrificial rites may fall,</p>
<p>Horns full of mead, as was the custom wise;</p>
<p>They lacked naught to make their sacrifice,</p>
<p>The temple incense-filled, the hangings fair.</p>
<p>Then Emily with heart tender as air,</p>
<p>Her body washed with water from the well,</p>
<p>How she performed her rite I dare not tell,</p>
<p>Unless it were but to speak in general –</p>
<p>Yet it would be a pleasure to hear all!</p>
<p>If a man means well who then should care;</p>
<p>Rather it is good to wander everywhere.</p>
<p>Her bright hair was combed, un-plaited all;</p>
<p>Of Turkey-oak a green coronal</p>
<p>Upon her head was placed, fair and fit.</p>
<p>Two fires on the altar-hearth she set,</p>
<p>And made her rite, as men are told</p>
<p>By Statius, of Thebes, and books of old.</p>
<p>When kindled was the fire, with piteous face,</p>
<p>To Diana, as you may hear, she spake:</p>
<p>‘O chaste goddess of the woods green,</p>
<p>By whom heaven and sea and earth are seen,</p>
<p>Queen of the realm of Pluto dark below,</p>
<p>Goddess of maidens, who my heart does know</p>
<p>And has many a year, all that I desire,</p>
<p>Keep me from your vengeance and your ire,</p>
<p>That Actaeon paid for cruelly!</p>
<p>Chaste goddess, well you know of me</p>
<p>That I wish to live a maid all my life,</p>
<p>Never will I be lover fond, or wife.</p>
<p>I am, you know, still of your company,</p>
<p>A maid, and love hunting and archery,</p>
<p>And to wander in the woodland wild,</p>
<p>Not to be made a wife and be with child.</p>
<p>Nor would I know the company of man.</p>
<p>Now help me lady, since you may and can,</p>
<p>By those three forms of you that in you be,</p>
<p>And Palamon, who has such love of me,</p>
<p>And Arcita too, who loves me sore.</p>
<p>This grace I pray you, and no more:</p>
<p>Send love and peace betwixt those two,</p>
<p>And turn their hearts away from me so,</p>
<p>That all their hot love and their desire,</p>
<p>And all their busy torment and their fire</p>
<p>Be quenched, or turned towards another face.</p>
<p>And if so be you will not grant me grace,</p>
<p>Or if my destiny be shaped, and you,</p>
<p>Rule I must yet have one of the two,</p>
<p>Then send me him that most desires me.</p>
<p>Behold, goddess of sacred chastity,</p>
<p>The bitter tears that down my cheeks fall!</p>
<p>Since you are maid and leader of us all,</p>
<p>My maidenhood protect and well conserve</p>
<p>And while I live, as maid I will you serve.’</p>
<p>The fires burned upon the altar clear</p>
<p>While Emily was thus in prayer,</p>
<p>But suddenly she saw a strange sight.</p>
<p>For all at once one of the fires died,</p>
<p>And quickened again, and then anon</p>
<p>The other fire quenched and was gone.</p>
<p>And as it died it made a whistling</p>
<p>As green brands do in their burning,</p>
<p>And at the brand’s end out ran anon</p>
<p>As it were bloody drops, many a one.</p>
<p>Seeing this Emily was so terrified</p>
<p>That she, well nigh mad, began to cry;</p>
<p>For she knew not what it signified,</p>
<p>But only out of fear had she cried,</p>
<p>And wept so it was pitiful to hear.</p>
<p>And at this point Diana did appear,</p>
<p>With bow in hand, dressed as a huntress,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Daughter, put away your sadness!</p>
<p>Among the gods on high it is affirmed,</p>
<p>And by eternal writ it is confirmed,</p>
<p>You shall be wedded to one of those</p>
<p>That suffer for you such pain and woe;</p>
<p>But unto which of them I may not tell.</p>
<p>I can remain no longer, fare you well.</p>
<p>The fires that on my altar dance</p>
<p>Shall declare to you, ere you go hence,</p>
<p>The outcome of your love, in this case.’</p>
<p>And with these words, the arrows in their case</p>
<p>The goddess wore rattled, quivering,</p>
<p>And off she went, swiftly vanishing,</p>
<p>At which our Emily astounded was,</p>
<p>And said: ‘What means all this, alas?</p>
<p>I place myself under your protection</p>
<p>Diana, and I yield to your direction.’</p>
<p>And home she went anon the nearest way.</p>
<p>This the conclusion: and no more to say.</p>
<p>The next hour of Mars following this,</p>
<p>Arcita to the temple paid a visit,</p>
<p>To fiery Mars, to make his sacrifice,</p>
<p>With all the rites meet to pagan eyes.</p>
<p>With devout heart and true devotion,</p>
<p>To Mars himself he made this orison:</p>
<p>‘O mighty god, that in the regions cold</p>
<p>Of Thrace honoured are, and lordship hold,</p>
<p>And have in every kingdom, every land</p>
<p>Of weapons all control in your hand,</p>
<p>And as you wish their fates devise –</p>
<p>Accept from me this pious sacrifice.</p>
<p>If it be victory my youth deserve,</p>
<p>And if my strength be worthy to serve</p>
<p>Your godhead, and I be one of thine,</p>
<p>Then I pray you, pity this pain of mine,</p>
<p>For this suffering and this hot fire</p>
<p>In which you once burned with desire,</p>
<p>When you once enjoyed the beauty</p>
<p>Of fair young Venus fresh and free,</p>
<p>And took her in your arms at will –</p>
<p>Though once upon a time it brought you ill,</p>
<p>When Vulcan caught you in his snare</p>
<p>And found you lying with his wife there,</p>
<p>By all the sorrow that was in your heart,</p>
<p>Have pity now on my pain and smart.</p>
<p>I am young, untutored as you know</p>
<p>And I am afflicted more, I vow,</p>
<p>Than ever was any living creature;</p>
<p>For she who makes me all this woe endure</p>
<p>Cares not whether I sink or swim.</p>
<p>And well I know, before her love I win,</p>
<p>I must gain her by strength in this place;</p>
<p>And well I know, without help or grace</p>
<p>Of yours my strength nothing will avail.</p>
<p>Then help me, lord, let my arm not fail,</p>
<p>Because of the fire that once burnt thee,</p>
<p>As fiercely as this fire that now burns me,</p>
<p>And let me tomorrow win the victory.</p>
<p>Mine let the effort be, and yours the glory!</p>
<p>Your sovereign temple will I honour</p>
<p>Above all places, and evermore labour</p>
<p>In your might arts, and at your pleasure.</p>
<p>And in your temple I will hang my banner,</p>
<p>And all the emblems of my company;</p>
<p>And till the day I die, continually</p>
<p>Eternal fire before you I will mind.</p>
<p>And to this also my word I bind:</p>
<p>My beard, my hair that hangs all a-down</p>
<p>That never yet the touch has known</p>
<p>Of razor or of shears, to you I’ll give,</p>
<p>And be your true servant while I live.</p>
<p>Now, lord, have pity on my sorrows sore;</p>
<p>Give me the victory! I ask no more!’</p>
<p>The prayer ceased of Arcita the strong.</p>
<p>The rings on the temple door ere long,</p>
<p>And then the doors, rattled too at last,</p>
<p>At all of which Arcita stood aghast.</p>
<p>The fires burned on the altar bright,</p>
<p>So that all the temple they did light.</p>
<p>A sweet smell rose from the ground,</p>
<p>And Arcita quickly raised his hand,</p>
<p>And into the fire more incense cast,</p>
<p>With other rites too; and at the last</p>
<p>The statue of Mars’ mail-coat did ring,</p>
<p>And with that sound he heard a murmuring</p>
<p>Faint and low, that whispered: ‘Victory’!’</p>
<p> – For which he gave Mars honour and glory.</p>
<p>And so with joy, and hoping to do well,</p>
<p>Arcita’s to his lodgings, as I tell,</p>
<p>As glad as is a bird for the bright sun.</p>
<p>Immediately such strife was begun</p>
<p>Over this granting of his prayer, above,</p>
<p>Between Venus, the Goddess of Love,</p>
<p>And Mars so sternly armed for a fight,</p>
<p>That Jove was busied setting it aright,</p>
<p>Till pale Saturn their father cold,</p>
<p>Who knew so many trials of old,</p>
<p>Searched the past, applied his artistry</p>
<p>So that he swiftly pleased either party;</p>
<p>As it is said ‘Age has the advantage.’</p>
<p>In age is wisdom and ancient usage;</p>
<p>Men may the old out-run but not out-wit.</p>
<p>Saturn soon, to quell the strife a bit,</p>
<p>Although it is against his nature mind,</p>
<p>For all this strife sought remedy to find.</p>
<p>‘My dear daughter Venus,’ quoth Saturn,</p>
<p>‘My orbit, that makes so wide a turn,</p>
<p>Has more power than is known to man.</p>
<p>Mine is the drenching in the sea so wan;</p>
<p>Mine is the dark cell deep as is the moat;</p>
<p>Mine the strangling, hanging by the throat,</p>
<p>The murmurings, and the serfs rebelling,</p>
<p>The muttering, and secret poisoning.</p>
<p>I do vengeance and exact correction</p>
<p>While I am in the sign of the Lion.</p>
<p>Mine is the ruin of the lofty hall,</p>
<p>The falling of the tower and the wall</p>
<p>Upon the miner or the carpenter.</p>
<p>I slew Samson when he shook the pillar,</p>
<p>And mine are those maladies cold,</p>
<p>Dark treason and plotting from of old;</p>
<p>My aspect is the father of pestilence.</p>
<p>Now weep no more; by my diligence</p>
<p>This Palamon, who is your own knight,</p>
<p>Shall have his lady as you swore he might.</p>
<p>Though Mars shall help his knight, nonetheless</p>
<p>Betwixt you two there must in time be peace,</p>
<p>Though you be not of one disposition;</p>
<p>Which causes every day this division.</p>
<p>I am your grandfather, ready to do your will.</p>
<p>Weep now no more; I will your wish fulfil.’</p>
<p>Now will I cease to speak of gods above,</p>
<p>Of Mars, and Venus, Goddess of Love,</p>
<p>And tell you as plainly as I can</p>
<p>The grand result, for which I first began.</p>

<p>Great was the feast in Athens on that day;</p>
<p>And then the lively season of May</p>
<p>Put everyone in such good countenance</p>
<p>They all that Monday joust and dance,</p>
<p>Spend it in service fit for Venus’ eyes.</p>
<p>And because they needed all to arise</p>
<p>At an early hour to view the great fight,</p>
<p>Unto their rest they went that night.</p>
<p>And in the dawn, when day began to spring,</p>
<p>Of horse and harness noise and rattling</p>
<p>There was in all the hostelries around.</p>
<p>And to the palace rode there, with the sound,</p>
<p>Hosts of lords, mounted on steeds and palfreys.</p>
<p>There you might see workmanship of harness,</p>
<p>So strange and rich, and wrought with zeal</p>
<p>Of goldsmith’s art, embroidery and steel;</p>
<p>The shields bright, the casques and trappings,</p>
<p>Golden helms, mail, surcoats and trimmings,</p>
<p>Lords in fine clothing on their coursers,</p>
<p>Knights of the retinue, and also squires,</p>
<p>Nailing of spears, and helmet-buckling,</p>
<p>Strapping of shields, and thong-fastening.</p>
<p>Where work was needed, no man was idle.</p>
<p>The foaming steeds at golden bridle</p>
<p>Gnawing, and armourers swift also</p>
<p>With file and hammer pricking to and fro.</p>
<p>Yeomen on foot, commoners in a throng,</p>
<p>With short staves, all crowding there along;</p>
<p>Pipes, trumpets, kettle-drums, clarions,</p>
<p>That in the battle blow warlike songs;</p>
<p>The palace full of people up and down,</p>
<p>Here three, there ten, throwing it around,</p>
<p>The matter of these Theban knights two.</p>
<p>Some said thus, and some it shall be so;</p>
<p>Some agreed with him of the black beard,</p>
<p>Some with the bald, some the shaggy haired,</p>
<p>Some said he looked grim, and he would fight;</p>
<p>He has an axe that’s twenty pounds in weight.</p>
<p>Thus was the hall filled with speculating,</p>
<p>Long after the sun had begun to spring.</p>
<p>The great Theseus, from sleep awaking</p>
<p>With the minstrelsy and noise they were making,</p>
<p>Was yet in the chamber of his palace rich,</p>
<p>Till the Theban knights, honoured each</p>
<p>The same, were into the palace led.</p>
<p>Duke Theseus was at a window set,</p>
<p>Arrayed as a god seated on a throne.</p>
<p>The people pressed thither and right soon</p>
<p>To see him, and do him high reverence,</p>
<p>And then to hear both his command and sentence.</p>
<p>A herald on a scaffold shouted: ‘Ho!’</p>
<p>Till all the noise of people died below;</p>
<p>And when he saw the people were all still,</p>
<p>Thus he proclaimed the great Duke’s will:</p>
<p>‘Our lord the Duke has, in his discretion,</p>
<p>Decided that it would be mere destruction</p>
<p>Of noble blood to fight in the guise</p>
<p>Of mortal battle now in this assize.</p>
<p>Wherefore to guarantee that none shall die,</p>
<p>He will his former purpose modify.</p>
<p>No man, therefore, on pain of his life,</p>
<p>No kind of missile, pole-axe or short knife,</p>
<p>Shall to the lists send or thither bring,</p>
<p>No short sword, with point for biting,</p>
<p>Shall any man draw, or bear at his side.</p>
<p>Nor shall a man with his opponent ride</p>
<p>More than one course with sharp ground spear;</p>
<p>But fence, if he wish, on foot himself to spare.</p>
<p>And he that is defeated they shall take,</p>
<p>Not slain, but brought to the upright stake</p>
<p>That shall be set up by either side.</p>
<p>And taken there by force, shall there abide.</p>
<p>And if it so befalls the leader is taken</p>
<p>On either side, or his opponent’s slain,</p>
<p>No longer then shall the tourney last.</p>
<p>God speed you; go forth, lay on fast.</p>
<p>With long sword and maces fight your fill!</p>
<p>Go your ways now; this is your lord’s will.’</p>
<p>The voices of the people rose to heaven,</p>
<p>So loud they shouted with glad cries: ‘Amen,</p>
<p>God save a lord such as this, so good</p>
<p>He wills no destruction of noble blood!’</p>
<p>Up rise the trumpets and the melody,</p>
<p>And to the lists ride the company,</p>
<p>By command through the city large,</p>
<p>Hung with cloth of gold and no coarse serge,</p>
<p>Full like a lord this noble Duke does ride,</p>
<p>The two Thebans on his either side,</p>
<p>And after ride the Queen and Emily,</p>
<p>And after that another company</p>
<p>Of all and sundry, according to degree,</p>
<p>And thus they passed through the city,</p>
<p>And at the lists they arrived in time –</p>
<p>It was not of the day yet fully prime.</p>
<p>When Theseus had taken his high seat,</p>
<p>With Hippolyta the Queen, and Emily,</p>
<p>And other ladies in their ranks around,</p>
<p>Towards the seats pressed the crowd,</p>
<p>And westward through the gates under Mars,</p>
<p>Arcita and his hundred men of war,</p>
<p>With banner red has entered at once,</p>
<p>And at the selfsame moment Palamon</p>
<p>Beneath Venus eastward, to that place,</p>
<p>With banner white and bold of face.</p>
<p>In all the world of seeking up and down</p>
<p>So even a contest could ne’er be found,</p>
<p>Never such a pair of companies;</p>
<p>For there was none so wise that could see</p>
<p>That either of the other had advantage,</p>
<p>In worthiness, nor in rank, nor age;</p>
<p>So evenly were they matched, all guessed.</p>
<p>And in two fair ranks they began to mass.</p>
<p>When their names had been called everyone,</p>
<p>To show that in their number guile was none,</p>
<p>Then were the gates shut, and the cry was loud:</p>
<p>‘Do your duty now, young knights so proud!’</p>
<p>The heralds left their pricking up and down;</p>
<p>Now trumpets ring out and the clarion.</p>
<p>There is no more to say, but east and west</p>
<p>In go the spears firmly to their rests;</p>
<p>In go the sharp spurs to the horses’ side.</p>
<p>There men see who can joust and who can ride;</p>
<p>There shafts shiver on the shields thick;</p>
<p>One through his midriff feels the prick.</p>
<p>Up spring the spears twenty feet on high;</p>
<p>Out sweep the swords, as silver bright.</p>
<p>The helms they hew to pieces, cut to shreds;</p>
<p>Out bursts the blood in stern streams red.</p>
<p>With mighty maces the bones they smash;</p>
<p>One through the thickest of the throng has passed.</p>
<p>There the strong steeds stumble, down go all;</p>
<p>One rolls underfoot just like a ball;</p>
<p>One with a broken spear-shaft pounds,</p>
<p>Another hurtles with his mount to ground.</p>
<p>One through the body is hurt, him they take,</p>
<p>Despite his struggles, drag him to the stake;</p>
<p>As was agreed, and there he must abide.</p>
<p>Another is laid there on the other side.</p>
<p>And sometimes Theseus decrees a rest</p>
<p>To drink if they wish, and be refreshed.</p>
<p>Often this day have those Thebans two</p>
<p>Met together, and hurt their enemy too;</p>
<p>Each of the twain has unhorsed the other.</p>
<p>No tiger in the vale of Gargaphia,</p>
<p>When her whelp is stolen, when it’s little,</p>
<p>As Arcita on the hunt could be as cruel,</p>
<p>Through jealousy at heart, to Palamon;</p>
<p>Nor in Morocco is so fell a lion,</p>
<p>That hunted is, by hunger driven mad,</p>
<p>Nor of his prey desirous of the blood</p>
<p>As Palamon to slay Arcita now, his foe.</p>
<p>On their helmets bite the jealous strokes;</p>
<p>Out runs the blood, both their sides bleed.</p>
<p>Sometime an end there is of every deed;</p>
<p>For ere the sun had gone unto his rest,</p>
<p>The strong King Emetrius did arrest</p>
<p>Palamon as with Arcita he did fight,</p>
<p>And made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,</p>
<p>And twenty men with all their strength take</p>
<p>Him without surrendering, to the stake.</p>
<p>And riding to rescue our Palamon</p>
<p>Strong King Lycurgus is brought down,</p>
<p>And King Emetrius for all his strength,</p>
<p>Is hurled from his saddle a full sword’s length,</p>
<p>So fiercely did Palamon his last stroke make.</p>
<p>But all for naught; he was dragged to the stake.</p>
<p>His bold heart could help him not;</p>
<p>He must abide, now that he was caught,</p>
<p>By force, and by their rules of competition.</p>
<p>Who sorrows now but woeful Palamon,</p>
<p>Who can no more go in again and fight?</p>
<p>And when Theseus had seen this sight,</p>
<p>Unto the folk that fought every one</p>
<p>He cried: ‘Ho! No more, for it is done!</p>
<p>I will be true judge, no partisan</p>
<p>Theban Arcita shall have his Emily,</p>
<p>Whom, by his fate, he has fairly won.’</p>
<p>With that the crowd’s rejoicing began</p>
<p>So loud and tumultuous withall</p>
<p>It seemed the very lists would fall.</p>
<p>What can fair Venus do now, above?</p>
<p>What can she say? What does the Queen of Love</p>
<p>But weep there, frustrated of her will,</p>
<p>Till that her tears onto the lists down fell.</p>
<p>She said then: ‘I am ashamed, indeed.’</p>
<p>Saturn said: ‘Daughter, hold your peace!</p>
<p>Mars has his way; his knight has all his boon.</p>
<p>But, by my head, you shall be solaced soon.’</p>
<p>The trumpeters with their loud minstrelsy,</p>
<p>The heralds that yell and cry as loudly,</p>
<p>Overflowed with joy for Sir Arcita.</p>
<p>But hearken to me, quench the noise a little,</p>
<p>At the miracle that there befell anon.</p>
<p>This fierce Arcita, helm no longer on,</p>
<p>Riding his courser, to show his face,</p>
<p>Canters the whole length of the place,</p>
<p>Looking upward towards Emily;</p>
<p>And she to him shows an eye most friendly</p>
<p>(For women, to speak generally, will soon</p>
<p>Follow behind the favours of Fortune),</p>
<p>And she roused all the joy in his heart.</p>
<p>Out of the ground an infernal fury starts,</p>
<p>Sent from Pluto at request of Saturn;</p>
<p>From which his horse in fear tried to turn,</p>
<p>Leapt aside, but foundered as he leapt,</p>
<p>And before Arcita could protect</p>
<p>Himself, he pitched down on his head,</p>
<p>And lay there on the ground as he were dead,</p>
<p>His breast-bone shattered by the saddle-bow.</p>
<p>As black he lay as any coal or crow,</p>
<p>The blood had so mounted to his face.</p>
<p>Swiftly he was carried from the place,</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, to Theseus’ palace.</p>
<p>There he was separated from his harness,</p>
<p>And carried to a bed, with care thy strive,</p>
<p>For he is yet in memory and alive,</p>
<p>And ever crying out for Emily.</p>
<p>Duke Theseus with all his company,</p>
<p>Came slowly home to Athens his city,</p>
<p>With full display and great solemnity,</p>
<p>Despite this mishap that had chanced to fall,</p>
<p>He wished not to dishearten them all.</p>
<p>And men said that Arcita should not die;</p>
<p>He would be healed of injury by and by.</p>
<p>And in another thing they joyed again:</p>
<p>That of them all no man had been slain,</p>
<p>Though some were sorely hurt, and one</p>
<p>Above all, pierced through the breast-bone.</p>
<p>Then for other wounds, and broken arms,</p>
<p>Some had salves, and some had charms;</p>
<p>Purgatives and herbs steeped to the brim</p>
<p>They drink, as they hope to save a limb.</p>
<p>Thus the noble Duke as best he can</p>
<p>Comforts and so honours every man,</p>
<p>And then makes revel all the long night</p>
<p>For the foreign princes as was their right.</p>
<p>Of defeat there was scarcely a feeling,</p>
<p>Except as befits a tourney’s fighting.</p>
<p>For indeed they felt no discontent</p>
<p>As falling there was merely accident;</p>
<p>And then to be led by force to the stake,</p>
<p>Unyielding, by twenty knights that take</p>
<p>One person alone, and no more, though</p>
<p>Harried forth by arm, and foot, and toe,</p>
<p>And their steed too driven off with staves,</p>
<p>By footmen, both yeomen and their knaves –</p>
<p>Still was not counted a disgrace we see;</p>
<p>No man there could call it cowardly.</p>
<p>Therefore anon Duke Theseus decreed</p>
<p>To stifle all the rancour and jealousy,</p>
<p>The victory to one side and the other,</p>
<p>And either side as like as any brother.</p>
<p>And gave them gifts, according to degree,</p>
<p>And held a feast for fully days three,</p>
<p>And conveyed the kings worthily</p>
<p>Out of his town, some way on their journey.</p>
<p>And every man went home the nearest way;</p>
<p>There was no cry but: ‘Farewell, and good day!’</p>
<p>With this battle I shall now have done,</p>
<p>But speak of Arcita and Palamon.</p>
<p>Arcita’s breast swells, and the sore</p>
<p>Increases at his heart more and more.</p>
<p>The clotted blood, despite all leech-craft,</p>
<p>Corrupts and festers in his blood, so that</p>
<p>Neither the blood-letting nor the drinking,</p>
<p>Of herbs are any help, nor the cupping.</p>
<p>The ‘expulsive virtue’, dubbed ‘animal’,</p>
<p>From the virtue that is known as ‘natural’</p>
<p>Cannot void the venom or it expel.</p>
<p>The fibres of his lungs begin to swell,</p>
<p>And every muscle of his breast down</p>
<p>Is wasted by venom and corruption.</p>
<p>He cannot profit, striving to live,</p>
<p>From upward vomiting, downward laxative.</p>
<p>All of him is shattered in that region;</p>
<p>Nature there now has no dominion.</p>
<p>And certainly, where Nature will not work,</p>
<p>Farwell Physic! Go bear the man to church!</p>
<p>This is the sum of all: Arcita must die.</p>
<p>So he sent for Emily by and by,</p>
<p>And Palamon that was his cousin dear.</p>
<p>Then said he thus, as you shall now hear:</p>
<p>‘The woeful spirit, may not, within my heart</p>
<p>Show one iota of my sorrowful smart</p>
<p>To you, my lady, whom I love the most.</p>
<p>But I bequeath you service of my ghost</p>
<p>To you beyond every other creature</p>
<p>Since my life may no longer linger.</p>
<p>Alas the woe! Alas, the pains so strong</p>
<p>That I for you have suffered, and so long!</p>
<p>Alas, for death! Alas, my Emily!</p>
<p>Alas, the parting of our company!</p>
<p>Alas, my heart’s queen! Alas, my wife,</p>
<p>My heart’s lady, ender of my life!</p>
<p>What is this world? What can a man save?</p>
<p>Now with his love, now in his cold grave,</p>
<p>Lying alone, with none for company.</p>
<p>Farewell, my sweet foe, my Emily!</p>
<p>And soft take me in your arms, I pray,</p>
<p>For love of God, and hark to what I say.</p>
<p>I have to my cousin Palamon</p>
<p>Shown strife and rancour, many a day gone,</p>
<p>For love of you, and out of jealousy.</p>
<p>Yet Jupiter, so wise, my soul give leave</p>
<p>To speak of him, your servant, properly,</p>
<p>In every dimension, full and truly –</p>
<p>That is to say, truth, honour, knighthood,</p>
<p>Wisdom, humility, and noble kindred,</p>
<p>Generosity and all that is of that art –</p>
<p>So may Jupiter take my soul’s part,</p>
<p>For in this world right now know I none</p>
<p>So worthy to be loved as Palamon,</p>
<p>Who serves you, and will do all his life.</p>
<p>And if that ever you shall be a wife,</p>
<p>Forget not Palamon, the gentle man.’</p>
<p>With these words his speech to fail began,</p>
<p>For from his feet up to his breast was come,</p>
<p>The cold of death, that had him overcome.</p>
<p>And further yet, for in his arms two</p>
<p>The vital strength is lost and gone also.</p>
<p>Only the intellect, and nothing more,</p>
<p>That dwelt in his heart, sick and sore,</p>
<p>Was left to fail when the heart felt death.</p>
<p>His two eyes dimmed, and failed his breath,</p>
<p>But on his lady gazed while eye could see;</p>
<p>His last word was: ‘Mercy, Emily!’</p>
<p>His spirit changed house, and vanished there,</p>
<p>Where I have not been, so cannot say where.</p>
<p>Therefore I pause; I am no minister.</p>
<p>Of souls I find none in this register,</p>
<p>Nor any speculations would I tell</p>
<p>Of them, though some write where they dwell.</p>
<p>Arcita is cold; may Mars his soul receive!</p>
<p>Now will I speak concerning Emily.</p>
<p>Emily shrieked, and howled Palamon,</p>
<p>And Theseus took his sister up anon,</p>
<p>And bore her swooning from the corpse away.</p>
<p>What help is there in wasting all the day</p>
<p>Telling how she wept both eve and morrow?</p>
<p>For in such cases women feel such sorrow,</p>
<p>When their husband from them shall go,</p>
<p>That for the most part they sorrow so,</p>
<p>Or else fall into such a malady,</p>
<p>That at the last they die, the more surely.</p>
<p>Infinite are the sorrows and the tears</p>
<p>Of the old folk, and folk of tender years,</p>
<p>Through the town, mourning for the Theban.</p>
<p>For him there weeps both child and man.</p>
<p>There was not such weeping, for certain</p>
<p>When Hector was brought newly slain</p>
<p>To Troy. Alas the pity that was there! –</p>
<p>Rending of cheeks, and tearing of hair.</p>
<p>‘Why did you have to die?’ the women weep,</p>
<p>‘Owning gold enough, and your Emily?’</p>
<p>No man could bring cheer to Theseus,</p>
<p>Save for his old father Aegeus,</p>
<p>Who knew this world’s transmutations,</p>
<p>For up and down, had he seen alteration,</p>
<p>Joy after woe, and woe after gladness;</p>
<p>And gave him an example and a likeness.</p>
<p>‘Just as there never died man,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘That had not life on earth, in his degree,</p>
<p>Just so there never lived a man,’ he said,</p>
<p>‘In all this world that will not come to death.</p>
<p>This world is but a thoroughfare of woe,</p>
<p>And we are pilgrims passing to and fro.</p>
<p>Death is an end of every worldly sore,’</p>
<p>And after this he said a great deal more</p>
<p>To this effect, full wisely to exhort</p>
<p>The people, that they might find comfort.</p>
<p>Duke Theseus, with all his busy care,</p>
<p>Cast about now where the sepulchre</p>
<p>Of good Arcita might best sited be,</p>
<p>Most honourable too, in its degree.</p>
<p>And at the last came to the conclusion</p>
<p>That since at first Arcita and Palamon</p>
<p>Had for love made battle there between</p>
<p>Each other, in the same grove sweet and green,</p>
<p>Where he had known his amorous desires,</p>
<p>His lament for love, his own hot fires,</p>
<p>He would make a fire in which the office</p>
<p>Of funeral rites he might there accomplish.</p>
<p>And gave at once commands to hack and hew</p>
<p>The ancient oaks and lay them in a row,</p>
<p>In pyres so arranged that they would burn.</p>
<p>His officers with swift foot soon return</p>
<p>Having executed his commandment.</p>
<p>And after this Theseus has sent</p>
<p>A bier after, and all overspread,</p>
<p>With cloth of gold, the richest to be had.</p>
<p>And clad Arcita in a similar wise;</p>
<p>Upon his hands he had gloves white,</p>
<p>Then on his head a crown of laurel green</p>
<p>And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.</p>
<p>He laid him, bare of face, upon the bier;</p>
<p>At that his cries were pitiful to hear.</p>
<p>And that the people might see him, all,</p>
<p>When it was day he brought him to the hall,</p>
<p>That echoed with the crying and the sound.</p>
<p>Then came the woeful Theban Palamon,</p>
<p>With fluttering beard and ragged ashy hair,</p>
<p>In clothes black all stained with tears,</p>
<p>And, weeping beyond others, Emily,</p>
<p>The saddest there of all the company.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the service ought to be</p>
<p>The nobler and the richer in degree</p>
<p>Duke Theseus ordered them to bring</p>
<p>Three steeds trapped in steel all glittering,</p>
<p>And covered with the arms of Sir Arcita.</p>
<p>Upon these steeds, tall and white they were,</p>
<p>Folk were mounted, one man bore his shield,</p>
<p>Another his spear in his hands out-held;</p>
<p>The third he bore his bow, which was Turkish –</p>
<p>Of burnished gold the quiver and the harness –</p>
<p>And pacing slowly sorrowful they appeared,</p>
<p>Riding towards the grove, as you shall hear.</p>
<p>The noblest of the Greeks that were there</p>
<p>On their shoulders carried the bier,</p>
<p>With eyes red and wet, and slow their feet,</p>
<p>Through the city down the central street,</p>
<p>All spread with black and wondrous on high</p>
<p>With the same cloth blackened is the sky.</p>
<p>Upon the right hand went old Aegeus,</p>
<p>And on the other side Duke Theseus,</p>
<p>With vessels in their hands of gold full fine,</p>
<p>All full of honey, milk, and blood and wine;</p>
<p>And Palamon with his great company,</p>
<p>And after that came sorrowing Emily,</p>
<p>With fire in hand, as was then the practice,</p>
<p>To do the office of the funeral service.</p>
<p>Great labour and infinite preparing</p>
<p>Was at the service and the pyre-making,</p>
<p>That with its green top reached heavenward,</p>
<p>And its sides were twenty fathoms broad –</p>
<p>That is to say, the boughs stretched so wide.</p>
<p>With many a load of straw laid first beside –</p>
<p>But how the fire was built on a height,</p>
<p>Nor the names of all the trees alight –</p>
<p>Oak, fir, aspen, birch, linden, holm, and poplar,</p>
<p>Willow, elm, plane, ash, box, chestnut, laurel, alder,</p>
<p>Maple, thorn, beech, yew, hazel, cornel-tree,</p>
<p>How they were felled – will not be told by me;</p>
<p>Nor how up and down their divinities run,</p>
<p>All disinherited of their habitation,</p>
<p>In which they once dwelt in rest and peace –</p>
<p>The nymphs, and fawns, and hamadryades –</p>
<p>Nor how the creatures and the birds all</p>
<p>Fled in fright when trees began to fall;</p>
<p>Nor how the ground was fearful of the light,</p>
<p>That never used to know the sun so bright;</p>
<p>Nor how the fire was first laid with straw</p>
<p>And then dry sticks, cut three-ways with a saw,</p>
<p>And then with green wood and spiced leaf,</p>
<p>And then with cloth of gold and jewellery,</p>
<p>And garlands hanging, full of many a flower,</p>
<p>Myrrh and incense, with their great savour;</p>
<p>Nor how Arcita lay amongst all this;</p>
<p>Nor what richness about his body is;</p>
<p>Nor how Emily, as was the practice,</p>
<p>Thrust in the fire due the funeral service;</p>
<p>Nor how she swooned when men fed the fire;</p>
<p>Nor what she said, nor what was her desire,</p>
<p>Nor what jewels in the fire men cast,</p>
<p>When the fire was high and burning fast;</p>
<p>Nor how some cast their shields, some their spears,</p>
<p>Onto the pyre and the robes they wear,</p>
<p>And cups full of milk and wine and blood</p>
<p>To fan the flames, a maddened fiery flood;</p>
<p>Nor how the Greeks in a vast rout</p>
<p>Thrice rode round the fire, all about,</p>
<p>Widdershins, and all loudly shouting,</p>
<p>And thrice with their spears clattering,</p>
<p>And thrice how the ladies cry and weep,</p>
<p>And how homeward was lead our Emily;</p>
<p>Nor how Arcita is burnt to ashes cold;</p>
<p>Nor how the lyke-wake was held, all told,</p>
<p>Throughout the night; nor how the Greeks play</p>
<p>At funeral games, nor do I choose to say –</p>
<p>Who wrestled best, naked with oil anointed,</p>
<p>Nor who bore him best, was best appointed;</p>
<p>I will not tell how they all wandered home</p>
<p>To Athens when the funeral games were done,</p>
<p>But briefly to the point I will wend,</p>
<p>And make of my long tale an end.</p>
<p>By degrees, and some length of years,</p>
<p>All finished were the mourning and the tears</p>
<p>Of Greeks, by the general consent.</p>
<p>Then it seems they held a parliament</p>
<p>At Athens, on certain points and matters,</p>
<p>Among which points suggested was</p>
<p>Forging with certain countries an alliance,</p>
<p>Exacting the Thebans’ full compliance.</p>
<p>For which this noble Theseus anon</p>
<p>Ordered them to send for Palamon,</p>
<p>He not knowing what the cause or why.</p>
<p>Yet in his black clothes with mournful eye</p>
<p>He came in haste, and right obediently,</p>
<p>And then Theseus sent for Emily.</p>
<p>When they were seated, hushed all the place,</p>
<p>And Theseus had waited for a space</p>
<p>Ere any word came from his wise breast,</p>
<p>His eyes resting whereabouts they wished,</p>
<p>With a sad visage he sighed till all were still</p>
<p>And after that, right thus he spoke his will:</p>
<p>‘The First Mover of all cause above</p>
<p>When he first made the fair chain of love,</p>
<p>Great was the effect, noble his intent.</p>
<p>He knew well what he did, and what he meant.</p>
<p>For with that chain of fairest love he bound</p>
<p>The fire, the air, the water and the land,</p>
<p>In certain boundaries that they not flee.</p>
<p>That same prince and Mover,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Established in this world, a wretched one,</p>
<p>A certain length of days and a duration</p>
<p>To all that is engendered in this place,</p>
<p>Beyond the which days they might not pace,</p>
<p>Although they may well those days abridge.</p>
<p>There is no need authorities to enlist,</p>
<p>For it is proven by experience,</p>
<p>Unless I need to clarify the sense</p>
<p>So men may by this order well discern,</p>
<p>That the Mover is established and eterne.</p>
<p>And each man knows, unless he is a fool,</p>
<p>That every part derives from this whole;</p>
<p>For nature cannot take its beginning</p>
<p>From some part or fragment of a thing,</p>
<p>But from what is perfect and is stable,</p>
<p>Descending so, until corruptible.</p>
<p>And therefore, of his wise providence,</p>
<p>He has so well proclaimed his intent,</p>
<p>That species of things and their progression</p>
<p>Shall only endure by succession</p>
<p>And not eternally, I tell no lies,</p>
<p>As you may comprehend with your eyes.</p>
<p>Behold, the oak that has long nourishing,</p>
<p>From the day it first begins to spring,</p>
<p>And has so long a life, as we may see,</p>
<p>Yet at the last wasted is the tree.</p>
<p>Consider too how the hardest stone,</p>
<p>Under our feet on which we ride and go,</p>
<p>Yet wastes as it lies beside the way.</p>
<p>The broad river sometime falls away;</p>
<p>The great towns we see wane and wend.</p>
<p>So you may see that all this thing has end.</p>
<p>Of man and woman see we well also</p>
<p>That of necessity in one of these terms two –</p>
<p>That is to say, in youth or else in age –</p>
<p>Die they must, the king as shall the page.</p>
<p>Some in their beds, some in the deep sea,</p>
<p>Some on the battlefield as you may see.</p>
<p>There is no help – all goes the same way.</p>
<p>So all this thing must die as I say.</p>
<p>Who orders this but Jupiter the King,</p>
<p>That is the prince and cause of everything,</p>
<p>Turning all things back to their own source</p>
<p>From which they derive, the true resource?</p>
<p>And against this no creature that’s alive</p>
<p>Of any kind, can ever hope to strive.</p>
<p>So is it wisdom, it seems to me,</p>
<p>To make a virtue of necessity,</p>
<p>And make the best of what we did not choose,</p>
<p>And especially of what to all falls due.</p>
<p>And whoso grumbles at it, is a fool,</p>
<p>And is a rebel to him that all does rule.</p>
<p>And certainly, a man has most honour</p>
<p>Who dies in his prime, in the flower,</p>
<p>When he is assured of his good name.</p>
<p>Then has he done his friend and self no shame,</p>
<p>And gladder should a friend be of his death,</p>
<p>When with honour he yielded up his breath,</p>
<p>Than when his name enfeebled is by age,</p>
<p>And all forgotten are his knightly days.</p>
<p>Then is it best, to win a worthy fame,</p>
<p>To die when at the zenith of our name.</p>
<p>The contrary to all this is wilfulness.</p>
<p>Why do we grudge it? Why this heaviness,</p>
<p>That good Arcita, of chivalry the flower,</p>
<p>Departed in all honour, at his hour,</p>
<p>Out of the foul prison of this life?</p>
<p>Why grudge here, his cousin and his wife,</p>
<p>His welfare who loved them so well?</p>
<p>Can he thank them? God knows, no man shall!</p>
<p>– That both his soul and himself offend,</p>
<p>And yet their happiness cannot extend.</p>
<p>What can I conclude from this long story,</p>
<p>But after woe advise us to be merry,</p>
<p>And thank Jupiter for all his grace?</p>
<p>And ere that we depart from this place,</p>
<p>I suggest we make of sorrows two</p>
<p>One perfect joy, to last for ever too.</p>
<p>And look now, where most sorrow is herein,</p>
<p>There will I first bring comfort and begin.</p>
<p>Sister,’ quoth he, ‘this has my full assent,</p>
<p>With all the agreement of my parliament,</p>
<p>That gentle Palamon, your own true knight,</p>
<p>Who serves you with will, and heart, and might,</p>
<p>And always has, since you first him knew,</p>
<p>You shall take pity on with grace, and you</p>
<p>Shall take him for your husband and your lord.</p>
<p>Give me your hand, for this is our accord;</p>
<p>Let us now see your womanly pity.</p>
<p>He is a king’s brother’s son, indeed;</p>
<p>And though he were a poor bachelor,</p>
<p>Since he has served you for many a year,</p>
<p>And suffered for you such adversity,</p>
<p>He should be considered, believe me,</p>
<p>For gentle mercy ought to crown the right.’</p>
<p>Then said he thus to Palamon the knight:</p>
<p>‘I think you need but little sermoning</p>
<p>To give your own assent to this thing!</p>
<p>Come near, and take your lady by the hand.’</p>
<p>Between them was made anon the bond</p>
<p>That we call matrimony or a marriage,</p>
<p>By all of the council and the peerage.</p>
<p>And thus with all joy and melody</p>
<p>Has Palamon wedded his Emily;</p>
<p>And God, that all this wide world has wrought,</p>
<p>Send him his love, who has it dearly bought!</p>
<p>For now is Palamon in all things well,</p>
<p>Living in bliss, riches, and in health.</p>
<p>And Emily loves him so tenderly,</p>
<p>And he serves her so courteously,</p>
<p>That there was never a word between them</p>
<p>Of jealousy, or other vexation.</p>
<p>So ends Palamon and Emily,</p>
<p>And God save all this fair company! Amen.</p>

<p>When that the Knight had thus his tale told,</p>
<p>In all our company was nor young nor old</p>
<p>Who did not claim it as a noble story</p>
<p>And worthy to be stored in memory,</p>
<p>Especially the well-born, every one.</p>
<p>Our Host laughed, and swore: ‘We go on,</p>
<p>All goes aright; we’ve unbound the bale!</p>
<p>Let’s see now who shall tell another tale,</p>
<p>For truly the game is well begun.</p>
<p>Now you tell, Sir Monk, if you can,</p>
<p>Something to repay the Knight’s tale.’</p>
<p>The Miller, that for drunkenness was pale,</p>
<p>So that with effort on his horse he sat,</p>
<p>He would neither doff his hood or hat,</p>
<p>Nor wait for any man, in courtesy,</p>
<p>But in Pilate’s voice began, noisily</p>
<p>To swear: ‘By arms, and by blood and bones,</p>
<p>I know a noble tale I’ll tell at once,</p>
<p>With which I shall requite the Knight’s tale!’</p>
<p>Our Host saw that he was drunk with ale,</p>
<p>And said; ‘Wait now, Robin, dear brother;</p>
<p>Some fitter man shall tell us first another.</p>
<p>Wait now, and let us work it all seemly.’</p>
<p>‘By God’s soul,’ quoth the Miller, ‘not for me!</p>
<p>For I will speak or else go on my way.’</p>
<p>Our Host answered: ‘Tell on, as you may!</p>
<p>You are a fool; your wits are overcome.’</p>
<p>‘Now hearken,’ quoth the Miller, ‘all and some!</p>
<p>But first I’ll make a protestation</p>
<p>That I am drunk – I know it by my tongue.</p>
<p>And therefore, if that I misspeak or say,</p>
<p>Blame then the ale of Southwark, I pray.</p>
<p>For I will tell a legend from the life,</p>
<p>Both of a carpenter and of his wife,</p>
<p>How that at her a clerk set his cap.’</p>
<p>The Reeve answered, saying: ‘Hold your trap!</p>
<p>Have done with lewd drunken harlotry!</p>
<p>It is a sin and also greater folly</p>
<p>To slander any man, or him defame,</p>
<p>And give wives too an evil name.</p>
<p>There is plenty else at which to aim.’</p>
<p>The drunken Miller spoke up again,</p>
<p>And replied: ‘My dear brother Oswald,</p>
<p>He who has no wife, he is no cuckold;</p>
<p>But I say not that therefore you are one.</p>
<p>There be good wives and many a one,</p>
<p>And ever a thousand good for every bad;</p>
<p>You know it yourself unless you’re mad.</p>
<p>Why are you angry with my tale now?</p>
<p>I have a wife, indeed, as well as thou,</p>
<p>Yet not for the oxen in my plough,</p>
<p>Would I take it upon me for an hour</p>
<p>To believe it of myself that I was one.</p>
<p>I will believe indeed that I am none.</p>
<p>A husband should not be too inquisitive</p>
<p>Of God’s affairs, or how his wife live.</p>
<p>If he shares God’s abundance entire,</p>
<p>Of the rest he need not then enquire.’</p>
<p>What more can I say, the Miller there</p>
<p>His words for no man would forbear,</p>
<p>But told his churl’s tale in his own manner.</p>
<p>And I regret I must repeat it here;</p>
<p>And therefore every gentle soul I pray</p>
<p>Deem it not, for God’s sake, that I say</p>
<p>Ought by evil intent, but must rehearse</p>
<p>All their tales, for better or for worse,</p>
<p>Or else be somewhat false to the matter.</p>
<p>Therefore whoever thinks it idle chatter</p>
<p>Turn to another page, and choose a tale,</p>
<p>For you shall find enough, never fail,</p>
<p>Great and small, stories of genteelness,</p>
<p>And morality as well, and holiness.</p>
<p>Blame not me, if you choose amiss.</p>
<p>The Miller is a churl; you all know this.</p>
<p>So was the Reeve also, and others too,</p>
<p>And harlotry they told of, both the two.</p>
<p>Take thought, and hold me free of blame –</p>
<p>Man should not treat in earnest what’s a game.</p>


<p>Once upon a time there dwelt in Oxford</p>
<p>A rich churl, that took in guests to board,</p>
<p>And for his craft he was a carpenter.</p>
<p>With him there was dwelling a poor scholar</p>
<p>Who had learned the arts, but all his fancy</p>
<p>Was set on studying astrology,</p>
<p>And he could judge certain propositions</p>
<p>By the course of his investigations,</p>
<p>Should men ask of him at certain hours</p>
<p>If there would be drought or else showers,</p>
<p>Or if they should ask what might befall</p>
<p>Of sundry things – I could not tell them all.</p>
<p>This clerk was called courtly Nicholas.</p>
<p>Skilled in secret love affairs, and solace,</p>
<p>And withal was clever and discreet,</p>
<p>And to see was like a maiden meek.</p>
<p>A chamber had he in that hostelry,</p>
<p>Alone, without any company,</p>
<p>Elegantly garnished with herbs sweet;</p>
<p>And he himself as sweet as root may be</p>
<p>Of liquorice, or any zedoary.</p>
<p>His Almagest, and his library,</p>
<p>His astrolabe, belonging to his art,</p>
<p>His counters for arithmetic, laid apart</p>
<p>On shelves that stood at his bed’s head;</p>
<p>His cupboard covered with a cloth of red.</p>
<p>And above all a showy psaltery</p>
<p>On which at night he made melody</p>
<p>So sweetly that all the chamber rang;</p>
<p>And Angelus ad virginem he sang,</p>
<p>And after that he sang The King’s Note.</p>
<p>Full often blessed, was his merry throat.</p>
<p>And thus this sweet clerk his time spent,</p>
<p>With what his friends provided, and the rent.</p>
<p>This carpenter had wedded a new wife,</p>
<p>Whom he loved far more than his life.</p>
<p>Of eighteen years she was of age.</p>
<p>Jealous he was, and kept her in a cage,</p>
<p>For she was young and wild, and he was old,</p>
<p>And thought himself a likely cuckold.</p>
<p>He knew not Cato – his learning was crude –</p>
<p>Who advised a man to wed his similitude.</p>
<p>Men should wed according to their state,</p>
<p>For youth and age, at odds, end in debate.</p>
<p>But since he had fallen in the snare,</p>
<p>He must endure, as we, the weight of care. </p>
<p>Fair was this young wife, and then withal</p>
<p>Like a weasel’s her body, shapely, small.</p>
<p>A belt she wore, one all barred with silk;</p>
<p>An apron too, as white as morning milk,</p>
<p>Upon her hips, full of many a gusset.</p>
<p>White was her smock, embroidery set</p>
<p>Before, behind, on the collar all about,</p>
<p>Of coal-black silk, within and without.</p>
<p>The tapes of her white cap all together</p>
<p>Were of the same cloth as her collar;</p>
<p>Her broad headband of silk, and set full high.</p>
<p>And she had surely a flirtatious eye.</p>
<p>Plucked very fine were her eyebrows two,</p>
<p>And arched and black as any sloe too.</p>
<p>She was much more beautiful to see</p>
<p>That is the early blossoming pear-tree,</p>
<p>And softer than the wool on a wether;</p>
<p>And by her girdle hung a purse of leather,</p>
<p>Tasselled with green and pearled with brass,</p>
<p>In al this world, in seeking of a lass,</p>
<p>There’s no man with fancy so intense</p>
<p>Could dream of such a poppet, such a wench.</p>
<p>Full brighter was the shining of her hue</p>
<p>Than in the Mint a noble forged anew.</p>
<p>And for her singing, lively, voiced afar,</p>
<p>Like any swallow flitting through a barn.</p>
<p>Then she could skip and gambol, as I am</p>
<p>Assured, as any kid or calf behind its dam.</p>
<p>Her mouth was sweet as honeyed mead I’d say,</p>
<p>Or a hoard of apples swathed in heath or hay.</p>
<p>Skittish she was, as is a frisky colt,</p>
<p>Tall as a mast, and straight as a bolt.</p>
<p>A brooch she wore upon her low collar,</p>
<p>As broad as is the boss of a buckler.</p>
<p>Her shoes were laced on her legs high.</p>
<p>She was a primrose, lovely to the eye,</p>
<p>For any lord to take into his bed,</p>
<p>Or yet for any good yeoman to wed.</p>
<p>Now sirs, now, so things came to pass,</p>
<p>That one day this handsome Nicholas</p>
<p>Began with this young wife to fool and play,</p>
<p>While her husband was down Osney way –</p>
<p>As clerks are full of subtlety and tricks.</p>
<p>And covertly he caught her by the sex,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Sweetheart, unless I have my will</p>
<p>For secret love of you, then die I will!’</p>
<p>And held her hard by the haunch bones,</p>
<p>And: ‘Sweetheart, love me, now,’ he moans,</p>
<p>‘Or I will die, as God shall me save!’</p>
<p>And she leapt as a colt does, in the way</p>
<p>Of being shod, and turned her head away.</p>
<p>She said: ‘I will not kiss you, by my faith!</p>
<p>Why, let be’ quoth she, ‘let be, Nicholas!</p>
<p>Or I will cry “Now, help” and shout “Alas!”</p>
<p>Remove your hands, by every courtesy!’</p>
<p>Then Nicholas began to cry for mercy,</p>
<p>And spoke so fair, so earnestly did cast,</p>
<p>That she was hooked, and pledged her love at last,</p>
<p>And swore an oath, by Thomas, Saint of Kent,</p>
<p>That she would be at his commandment,</p>
<p>When she could find an opportunity.</p>
<p>‘My husband is so filled with jealousy</p>
<p>That unless you’re patient, secretive,</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘I know for sure I shall not live.</p>
<p>You must be wholly secret in this house.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, give that not a thought,’ quoth Nicholas,</p>
<p>‘A scholar would have wasted a good while</p>
<p>If he could not a carpenter beguile.’</p>
<p>And so they were agreed and both swore</p>
<p>To wait awhile, as I have said before.</p>
<p>When Nicholas had done so, as I tell,</p>
<p>And patted her about the buttocks well,</p>
<p>He kissed her sweet, and took his psaltery</p>
<p>And played away, and plucked a melody.</p>
<p>Then it befell, that to the parish church,</p>
<p>There to perform Christ’s own works,</p>
<p>This good wife went, on a holy day.</p>
<p>Her forehead shone as bright as any day,</p>
<p>So shiny was it when she left her work.</p>
<p>Now there was a parish clerk of that church,</p>
<p>And this clerk’s name was Absolon.</p>
<p>Curly was his hair, and as the gold it shone,</p>
<p>And stuck out in a fan wide and broad.</p>
<p>Full straight and even his parting showed;</p>
<p>His face was red, his eyes grey as a goose.</p>
<p>With St Paul’s tracery carved in his shoes,</p>
<p>In red hose he dressed elegantly.</p>
<p>He was clothed neatly and properly</p>
<p>Adorned with a light-blue cloth jacket,</p>
<p>Full fair and densely were the laces set.</p>
<p>And over it he wore a fine surplice</p>
<p>As white as the blossom on the spray is.</p>
<p>A merry youth he was, so God me save!</p>
<p>Well knew he how to let blood, clip and shave,</p>
<p>And draw up deeds of land or quittance.</p>
<p>In twenty manners he could trip and dance,</p>
<p>After the true school of Oxford though,</p>
<p>And with his legs leaping to and fro,</p>
<p>And playing songs on a two-stringed fiddle;</p>
<p>Thereto he sometimes sang a high treble,</p>
<p>And he could play as well on a cithern.</p>
<p>In all the town no brew-house nor tavern</p>
<p>He did not visit with his power to solace,</p>
<p>Where any gaily-dressed barmaid was.</p>
<p>But truth to tell, quite squeamish he was</p>
<p>About farting, and in speech fastidious.</p>
<p>Absolon, who was gallant in his way,</p>
<p>Would bear the censer round on holy days,</p>
<p>Censing the parish wives whom he passed;</p>
<p>And many a fond look on them he cast,</p>
<p>And especially on the carpenter’s wife.</p>
<p>To look at her brightened up his life,</p>
<p>She was so trim and sweet and amorous.</p>
<p>I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,</p>
<p>And he a cat, she’d have been leapt upon.</p>
<p>This parish clerk, this gallant Absolon,</p>
<p>Has in his heart such a love-longing</p>
<p>That from no wife would he take offerings;</p>
<p>For courtesy, he said, he would take none.</p>
<p>The moon, when it was night, full bright shone,</p>
<p>And Absalon his cithern did take;</p>
<p>For love indeed he thought to wake.</p>
<p>And off he went, lively and amorous,</p>
<p>Till he came to the carpenter’s house,</p>
<p>Arriving there a little after cock-crow,</p>
<p>And placed himself by a casement window,</p>
<p>That was let into the carpenter’s wall.</p>
<p>He sings in a voice, graceful and small:</p>
<p>‘Now dear lady, if your wish it be,</p>
<p>I pray you to have mercy upon me’,</p>
<p>In harmony with his music-making.</p>
<p>The carpenter awoke and heard him singing,</p>
<p>And spoke to his wife and said anon,</p>
<p>‘What Alison, do you hear Absalon,</p>
<p>Singing thus under our bedroom wall?’</p>
<p>And she answering her husband’s call:</p>
<p>‘Yes, God knows John, I hear it very well.’</p>
<p>And so it goes; what more must I tell?</p>
<p>From day to day this lively Absalon</p>
<p>So woos her that he is woebegone.</p>
<p>He lay awake all night, and then daily</p>
<p>He combed his curling locks and gaily,</p>
<p>He wooed by go-betweens, and brokerage,</p>
<p>And swore he would be her own true page;</p>
<p>He sang and warbled like a nightingale;</p>
<p>He sent her mead, sweet wine, and spiced ale,</p>
<p>And flat cakes, piping hot from the oven,</p>
<p>And as she lived in town, coins to spend.</p>
<p>For some folk are conquered by riches,</p>
<p>And some by blows, and some by kindness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to show skill and agility,</p>
<p>He played Herod in the Mysteries.</p>
<p>But what good did it do him, alas?</p>
<p>She so loves the handsome Nicholas</p>
<p>That Absalon might go blow his horn;</p>
<p>For all his labour there was only scorn.</p>
<p>And thus she made Absalon her dupe,</p>
<p>And of all his eager wooing a joke.</p>
<p>True indeed the proverb, and no lie,</p>
<p>That men repeat: ‘Ever the sly, nearby,</p>
<p>Makes the distant lover out of favour.’</p>
<p>Though Absalon knew madness or anger,</p>
<p>Because he was further from her sight,</p>
<p>Nicholas nearby stood in his light.</p>
<p>Now do well, you handsome Nicholas!</p>
<p>For Absalon must wail and sing ‘alas!’</p>
<p>And so it befell, on a Saturday</p>
<p>The carpenter had gone down to Osney;</p>
<p>And handsome Nicholas and Alison</p>
<p>Both agreed regarding this decision,</p>
<p>That Nicholas shall devise some wile</p>
<p>This jealous foolish husband to beguile.</p>
<p>And if the game turned out alright,</p>
<p>She would sleep in his arms all night;</p>
<p>For this was her desire and his too.</p>
<p>And straight away, without more ado,</p>
<p>This Nicholas wishing not to tarry,</p>
<p>But quietly to his room does carry</p>
<p>Both meat and drink, to last a day</p>
<p>Or two, and told Alison to say,</p>
<p>If her husband asked for Nicholas,</p>
<p>That she had no idea where he was;</p>
<p>That all the day of him she’d had no sight;</p>
<p>She thought he might be ill, so he might,</p>
<p>For he had not answered the maid’s call;</p>
<p>Gave no reply, whatever might befall.</p>
<p>This continued all that Saturday,</p>
<p>And Nicholas still in his chamber lay,</p>
<p>And eat and slept, as pleased him best,</p>
<p>Till Sunday, when the sun went to its rest.</p>
<p>The foolish carpenter wondered without fail</p>
<p>About our Nicholas, why he should ail,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I fear by Saint Thomas,</p>
<p>That all is not well with Nicholas.</p>
<p>God forbid that he die suddenly!</p>
<p>This world is now so fickle indeed;</p>
<p>I saw a corpse today borne to church</p>
<p>That only Monday last I saw at work.</p>
<p>‘Go up,’ quoth he to his lad anon,</p>
<p>‘Call at the door, or tap it with a spoon.</p>
<p>See how things are, and tell me swiftly.’</p>
<p>The serving-boy climbed up sturdily,</p>
<p>And at the chamber door a while the lad,</p>
<p>Called and knocked, as though he were mad.</p>
<p>‘What how! What do you, Master Nicholay?</p>
<p> How can you lie asleep the livelong day?’</p>
<p>– But all for naught; he heard not a word.</p>
<p>A hole he found, down by the skirting-board,</p>
<p>Through which the cat was wont to creep,</p>
<p>And into that hole he gazed full deep,</p>
<p>And at last a glimpse met his sight</p>
<p>Of Nicholas lying gaping there upright,</p>
<p>As if he had caught sight of the new moon.</p>
<p>Down he goes, to tell his master, soon</p>
<p>Of the state in which he found the man.</p>
<p>The carpenter to bless himself began,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Help us, Saint Frideswide!</p>
<p>A man little knows what shall betide.</p>
<p>This man has fallen, through astronomy,</p>
<p>Into some madness, or some agony.</p>
<p>I always thought that’s how it would be;</p>
<p>Men should know what God meant us to see.</p>
<p>Yes, blessed always is the simple man,</p>
<p>With nothing but his faith to understand!</p>
<p>So fared another clerk’s astronomy;</p>
<p>He walked, in the fields, into the starry</p>
<p>Sky to pry, and see what should befall,</p>
<p>Till into the marl-pit he took a fall;</p>
<p>He saw not that! But yet, by Saint Thomas,</p>
<p>I’m truly worried for poor Nicholas.</p>
<p>He shall be scolded for his studying,</p>
<p>If scold I may, by Jesus, Heaven’s king!</p>
<p>Get me a stave to work against the floor,</p>
<p>While you, Robin, heave at the door.</p>
<p>He’ll wake from his studying, I guess.’</p>
<p>And to the chamber door he gave address.</p>
<p>His lad was a fellow big and strong,</p>
<p>And heaved it off its hinges at once;</p>
<p>Onto the floor the door fell anon.</p>
<p>Nicholas sat there yet, still as stone,</p>
<p>And kept on gaping up into the air.</p>
<p>The carpenter thought him in despair,</p>
<p>And grasped him by the shoulders mightily</p>
<p>And shook him hard, and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>‘What, Nicholas, what ho! What, look down!</p>
<p>Awake, and think you of Christ’s passion!</p>
<p>I guard you with the cross from elf and sprite.’</p>
<p>– With that the night-spell he said outright</p>
<p>On all the four sides of the house about,</p>
<p>And on the threshold of the door without.</p>
<p>‘Jesus Christ, and Saint Benedict,</p>
<p>Guard this house from all things wicked,</p>
<p>All night through, white Pater noster!</p>
<p>Where went thou, Saint Peter’s sister?’</p>
<p>And at last our handsome Nicholas</p>
<p>Began to sigh deeply, and said: ‘Alas!</p>
<p>Shall the world be lost and doomed now?</p>
<p>The carpenter replied: ‘What say thou?</p>
<p>What, think on God, as we do, working men!’</p>
<p>And Nicholas answered: ‘Fetch me drink then,</p>
<p>And afterwards I’ll speak, in privacy,</p>
<p>Of certain things regarding you and me;</p>
<p>I will tell them to no other man, that’s certain.’</p>
<p>The carpenter went down, and back again</p>
<p>Brought of powerful ale a large quart.</p>
<p>And when each of them had drunk his part,</p>
<p>Nicholas went swift to his door and shut it,</p>
<p>And made the carpenter beside him sit,</p>
<p>And said: ‘John, my good host and dear,</p>
<p>You shall upon your oath swear me here</p>
<p>That to no man this secret you’ll betray;</p>
<p>For it is Christ’s counsel that I say,</p>
<p>And if you tell it man, you are no more,</p>
<p>For this vengeance fall on you therefore,</p>
<p>You will be mad, let that be understood’</p>
<p>‘Nay, Christ forbid it, for his holy blood!’</p>
<p>Quoth then this foolish man: ‘I’ll not blab,</p>
<p>No, though it’s I who say it, I never gab.</p>
<p>Say what you will: I shall never tell</p>
<p>Child nor wife, by him that harrowed Hell!’</p>
<p>‘Now John,’ quoth Nicholas, ‘No lies from me;</p>
<p>I have found through my astrology,</p>
<p>As I gazed into the moon so bright,</p>
<p>That Monday next, a fourth part of the night,</p>
<p>A rain shall fall, as wild, as mad, as could</p>
<p>That half so great was never Noah’s flood.</p>
<p>This world,’ said he, ‘in less than an hour</p>
<p>Shall all be drowned, so hideous the shower.</p>
<p>Thus shall all mortals drown and lose their life’</p>
<p>The carpenter replied: ‘Alas, my wife!</p>
<p>And shall she drown? Alas, my Alison!’</p>
<p>For sorrow of this he almost fell, anon</p>
<p>He said: ‘Is there no remedy in this pass?’</p>
<p>‘Why yes, by God!’ quoth handsome Nicholas.</p>
<p>– If you will act on wise advice indeed.</p>
<p>You mustn’t follow where your own thoughts lead;</p>
<p>For thus says Solomon, who speaks the truth:</p>
<p>‘Act on advice, and you shall nothing rue.’</p>
<p>And if you will act on good counsel,</p>
<p>I undertake, without a mast or sail,</p>
<p>That I shall save her, and you, and me, for</p>
<p>Have you not heard how saved was Noah,</p>
<p>When that our Lord had warned him before</p>
<p>That all the world with water should be o’er?</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ quoth the carpenter, ‘long long ago.’</p>
<p>‘Have you not heard,’ quoth Nicholas, ‘also</p>
<p>The sorrow of Noah, with his fellowship,</p>
<p>Before he could get his wife to ship?</p>
<p>He’d have preferred, I dare well say, alack,</p>
<p>At that time, rather than his wethers black</p>
<p>That she had had a ship to herself alone!</p>
<p>And therefore know you what must be done?</p>
<p>This demands haste, and of a hasty thing</p>
<p>Men may not preach or ask for tarrying;</p>
<p>Anon and quickly get, and bring us in</p>
<p>A kneading trough, or that for brewing,</p>
<p>One for each of us – but see they’re large –</p>
<p>In which we can sail as in a barge,</p>
<p>And have in there victuals sufficient</p>
<p>For a day – and never mind the remnant!</p>
<p>The water shall abate and drain away</p>
<p>About nine in the morning, the next day.</p>
<p>But Robin, must not know of this, your knave,</p>
<p>Nor your maid Jill, her too I cannot save.</p>
<p>Ask not why, for though you ask of me,</p>
<p>I will not tell God’s secret as must be.</p>
<p>Let that suffice, and unless you’re mad</p>
<p>Accept as great a grace as Noah had.</p>
<p>Your wife I shall save without a doubt.</p>
<p>Go now your ways, and speed hereabout.</p>
<p>And when you have for her, and you and me,</p>
<p>Brought in these kneading-tubs, all three,</p>
<p>Then shall you hang them in the attic high,</p>
<p>That no man may our preparations spy.</p>
<p>And when you thus have done as I have said,</p>
<p>And have placed in them our meat and bread,</p>
<p>And an axe to smite the rope in two also,</p>
<p>When the water comes, we may go</p>
<p>And break a hole up high, in the gable,</p>
<p>On the garden side above the stable,</p>
<p>So we can pass freely on our way,</p>
<p>When the great shower has gone away.</p>
<p>Then shall you swim as merry, I undertake,</p>
<p>As does the white duck following her drake.</p>
<p>Then will I call: ‘Now, Alison, Now John!</p>
<p>Be merry for the flood will soon be gone!’</p>
<p>And you will say: ‘Hail, Master Nicholay!</p>
<p>Good morrow, I see you well, for it is day.’</p>
<p>And then shall we be lords all our life</p>
<p>Of all the world, as Noah and his wife.</p>
<p>But of one thing I warn you of right:</p>
<p>Be well advised, on that same night</p>
<p>That we take ship, and go on board,</p>
<p>None of must speak or say a word,</p>
<p>Nor call out, nor cry, but fall to prayer,</p>
<p>For it is God’s own command clear.</p>
<p>Your wife and you must far apart begin,</p>
<p>So that betwixt you there shall be no sin,</p>
<p>No more in looking than there is in deed.</p>
<p>This decree is made; go, and God speed!</p>
<p>Tomorrow at night when folk are all asleep,</p>
<p>Into our kneading-tubs shall we creep,</p>
<p>And there we’ll sit, abiding God’s grace.</p>
<p>Go now your way; I have no more space</p>
<p>To make of this a longer sermoning.</p>
<p>Men say thus: ‘Send the wise, say nothing.’</p>
<p>You are so wise I have no need to preach.</p>
<p>Go, save our lives, and do as I beseech!’</p>
<p>This foolish carpenter goes on his way;</p>
<p>Full often says: ‘Alas!’ and Well-away!’</p>
<p>And to his wife he told it secretly;</p>
<p>And she already knew as well as he</p>
<p>What this ingenious plan might signify.</p>
<p>But nonetheless she made as if to die,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Alas, be on your way anon!</p>
<p>Help us escape, or we be dead each one!</p>
<p>I am your true and very wedded wife;</p>
<p>Go dear spouse, and help to save my life.’</p>
<p>Lo, what a great thing is emotion!</p>
<p>Men may die of imagination,</p>
<p>So deep the impression it may make.</p>
<p>This foolish carpenter began to quake;</p>
<p>He truly thought that he could see</p>
<p>Noah’s flood come surging like the sea</p>
<p>To drown Alison, his honey dear.</p>
<p>He weeps and wails, with sorry fear;</p>
<p>He sighs with sorrowful groan enough;</p>
<p>He goes to fetch a kneading-trough,</p>
<p>And after a tub, and one for brewing;</p>
<p>And secretly he carried them in,</p>
<p>And hung them from the roof in secrecy.</p>
<p>With his own hands he made ladders three</p>
<p>To climb up by the rungs and so after</p>
<p>Reach the tubs hanging in the rafters,</p>
<p>And victualled them both trough and tub,</p>
<p>With bread and cheese, and good ale in a jug,</p>
<p>Sufficient right enough to last a day.</p>
<p>But ere he had made all this array,</p>
<p>He sent his lad and the wench also</p>
<p>On business to London for to go.</p>
<p>And on the Monday, as it drew to night,</p>
<p>He shut his door, without a candle bright,</p>
<p>And readied everything as it should be;</p>
<p>And shortly up they climbed all three.</p>
<p>They sat still, some little time it was.</p>
<p>‘Pater noster, and be mum!’ said Nicholas,</p>
<p>And ‘mum’ said John, and ‘mum’ quoth Alison.</p>
<p>The carpenter completed his devotion,</p>
<p>And sat quite still, and said his prayer,</p>
<p>Awaiting rain, and tried if he could hear.</p>
<p>A dead sleep, from all this business,</p>
<p>Fell now on the carpenter (as I guess)</p>
<p>About curfew time, or a little more.</p>
<p>With troubling of his spirit he groaned sore,</p>
<p>And often snored, his head awry was.</p>
<p>Down the ladder steals our Nicholas,</p>
<p>And Alison, full softly down she sped.</p>
<p>Without more words they slip into the bed</p>
<p>Where the carpenter was wont to be;</p>
<p>There was the revel and the melody.</p>
<p>And thus lie Alison and Nicholas</p>
<p>At the affair of mirth and solace,</p>
<p>Till the bell for lauds began to ring,</p>
<p>And the friars in the chancel to sing.</p>
<p>The parish clerk, the amorous Absolon,</p>
<p>Who for love was always woebegone,</p>
<p>Upon the Monday was down at Osney</p>
<p>To disport and play, in company,</p>
<p>And chanced to ask a fellow cloisterer,</p>
<p>Privately, of John the carpenter.</p>
<p>The fellow drew him outside the church,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I know not; he’s not been at work</p>
<p>Since Saturday. I think that he went</p>
<p>For timber, where our Abbot had him sent;</p>
<p>For he for timber frequently will go</p>
<p>And stay at the grange a day or so –</p>
<p>Or else he at his house, I would maintain.</p>
<p>Where exactly, I could not be sure again.’</p>
<p>Now Absalon full jolly was and light</p>
<p>Of heart and thought: ‘I’ll wake tonight,</p>
<p>For certainly I’ve not seen him stirring</p>
<p>About his door since day began to spring.</p>
<p>So might I thrive, I shall at cock’s crow</p>
<p>Knock all secretly at his window,</p>
<p>That’s placed low upon his chamber wall.</p>
<p>And Alison now I will tell of all</p>
<p>My love-longing, and will scarcely miss</p>
<p>At least from her the favour of a kiss.</p>
<p>Some sort of comfort I’ll have, by faith.</p>
<p>My mouth has itched all this long day;</p>
<p>That is a sign of kissing at the least.</p>
<p>All night I dreamed that I was at a feast.</p>
<p>Therefore I’ll go and sleep an hour say,</p>
<p>And then all night will I wake and play.’</p>
<p>When the first cock had crowed, anon</p>
<p>Up rose this jolly lover, Absalon,</p>
<p>And gaily dressed to perfection is,</p>
<p>But first chews cardamom and liquorice,</p>
<p>To smell sweet, before he combs his hair.</p>
<p>Under his tongue true-love (Herb Paris) there,</p>
<p>And in that way to be gracious he set out.</p>
<p>He wanders off to the carpenter’s house,</p>
<p>And stood there still under the casement window –</p>
<p>Until it touched his breast it was so low –</p>
<p>And soft he coughed with a gentle sound:</p>
<p>‘What do you, honeycomb, sweet Alison?</p>
<p>My fair bride, my sweet cinnamon!</p>
<p>Awake, my lover, speak to me, come!</p>
<p>So little you think upon my woe,</p>
<p>That for love I faint wherever I go.</p>
<p>No wonder is it that I faint and sweat;</p>
<p>I pine just as a lamb does for the teat,</p>
<p>Surely, darling, I have such love-longing</p>
<p>That like a turtle-dove is my pining;</p>
<p>I scarcely eat as little as does a maid.’</p>
<p>‘Away from the window, Jack fool,’ she said.</p>
<p>‘So help me God, there’s no “come up and kiss me”!</p>
<p>I love another – and unless I mistake me –</p>
<p>A better than you, by Jesus, Absalon.</p>
<p>Go on your way, or I will hurl a stone,</p>
<p>And let me sleep, in the devil’s name, away!’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth Absalon, ‘and well-away,</p>
<p>That true love was ever so ill bestowed!</p>
<p>Then kiss me, if that’s the most you owe,</p>
<p>For Jesus love, and for the love of me.’</p>
<p>‘Will you go your way with it?’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘Yes, darling, certainly,’ quoth Absalon.</p>
<p>‘Then be ready,’ quoth she, ‘I come anon.’</p>
<p>And to Nicholas she said: Be still!</p>
<p>Now hush, and you can laugh your fill!’</p>
<p>Then Absalon went down on his knees,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I am a lord in every degree,</p>
<p>For after this I hope for more hereafter.</p>
<p>Lover your grace, and sweet bride your favour!’</p>
<p>The window she undoes and that in haste.</p>
<p>‘Now do,’ quoth she, ‘come on, no time to waste,</p>
<p>Lest that our neighbours should you espy.’</p>
<p>Then Absalon first wiped his mouth full dry.</p>
<p>Dark was the night like to pitch or coal,</p>
<p>And at the window out she put her hole,</p>
<p>And Absalon, had better nor worse than this,</p>
<p>That with his mouth her naked arse he kissed</p>
<p>Before he was aware, had savoured it.</p>
<p>Back he started, something was amiss,</p>
<p>For well he knew a woman has no beard.</p>
<p>He felt something rough, and long-haired,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Fie, alas, what have I done?’</p>
<p>‘Tee-hee!’ quoth she, and clapped the window shut,</p>
<p>And Absolon goes off with saddened pace.</p>
<p>‘A beard, a beard!’ quoth spritely Nicholas,</p>
<p>‘By God’s body, that went fair and well!’</p>
<p>Now Absolon heard every word himself,</p>
<p>And began his lip in anger to bite,</p>
<p>And to himself he said: ‘I’ll you requite!’</p>
<p>Who rubs himself, who scrubs at his mouth,</p>
<p>With dust, sand, chippings, straw and cloth</p>
<p>But Absolon, who often cries: ‘Alas!</p>
<p>My soul consign to Satan, if I’d have</p>
<p>This town before my vengeance,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘For this humiliation well repaid I’ll be.</p>
<p>Alas,’ quoth he, ‘that I never blenched!’</p>
<p>His hot love was cold and all quenched,</p>
<p>For from the time that her arse he kissed</p>
<p>Love he valued less than a stalk of cress,</p>
<p>For he was healed of his malady.</p>
<p>And love he did defy eternally.</p>
<p>And weeping like a child they look to beat,</p>
<p>At gentle pace he slowly crossed the street,</p>
<p>To a smith, and he called Gervase is,</p>
<p>Who forges on his anvil harnesses;</p>
<p>He sharpens shares and coulters busily.</p>
<p>Absalon knocked on the doors all easily,</p>
<p>And said: Open, Gervase, and quick anon!’</p>
<p>‘What, who is that? ‘It’s me, Absalon.’</p>
<p>‘What, Absalon! Christ’s blessed tree, I say,</p>
<p>Why up so early? Benedicite,</p>
<p>What ails you? Some fine girl, at a glance,</p>
<p>Has brought you out on reconnaissance;</p>
<p>By St Neot, you know well what I mean!’</p>
<p>But Absalon, he gave never a bean</p>
<p>For all the jesting; silently did stand.</p>
<p>He had a deal more business on hand</p>
<p>Than Gervase knew, and said: ‘Friend, so dear,</p>
<p>That hot coulter in the chimney there,</p>
<p>Please lend it me; I’ve something needs doing,</p>
<p>And full soon to you again it I’ll bring.’</p>
<p>Gervase answered: ‘Even if it were gold,</p>
<p>Or a bag full of nobles, all untold,</p>
<p>You should have it, as I’m a true smith!</p>
<p>Now, Christ’s foe, what would you do with it?’</p>
<p>‘Let that, ‘quoth Absalon, ‘be it as it may;</p>
<p>I’ll tell you of it all another day’ –</p>
<p>And caught the coulter by the cold steel.</p>
<p>Softly out the door he began to steal,</p>
<p>And then went off to the carpenter’s wall.</p>
<p>First he coughed then he knocked withal</p>
<p>On the window, as loud as he dared</p>
<p>Then Alison answered: ‘Who’s there,</p>
<p>That knocks so? I warrant it’s a thief!’</p>
<p>‘Why no’ quoth he, ‘Not so, by my faith;</p>
<p>I am your Absalon, my sweet darling.</p>
<p>‘Of gold, quoth he, ‘I’ve brought you a ring.</p>
<p>My mother gave it me, so God me save.</p>
<p>Full fine it is, and carefully engraved;</p>
<p>This will I give you, if you will me kiss.’</p>
<p>Now Nicholas had risen for a piss,</p>
<p>And thought he would improve the jape:</p>
<p>He should kiss his arse ere he escape.</p>
<p>And he raised the window hastily,</p>
<p>And put his arse outside covertly,</p>
<p>Beyond the buttock, to the haunch-bone.</p>
<p>And then spoke up the clerk, Absalon:</p>
<p>‘Speak, sweet bird; I know not where you art.’</p>
<p>Then Nicholas at once let fly a fart,</p>
<p>As great as if it were a thunder-clap,</p>
<p>The clerk was nearly blinded with the blast;</p>
<p>Yet he was ready with his iron hot,</p>
<p>And Nicholas right in the arse he smote.</p>
<p>Off went the skin a hand’s breadth round and some;</p>
<p>The coulter had so burnt him on his bum,</p>
<p>That for the pain he thought he would die.</p>
<p>As if he were mad, he began to cry:</p>
<p>‘Help! Water, water, help, for God’s heart!’</p>
<p>The carpenter out of his slumber starts,</p>
<p>Hears him cry: ‘Water’ loud as ever he could,</p>
<p>And thought: ‘Alas, now here comes Noah’s flood!’</p>
<p>Up he sat at once, no more ado,</p>
<p>And with his axe he smote the cord in two,</p>
<p>And down he went – He had no time to sell</p>
<p>His bread or ale at all, but straight he fell</p>
<p>On to the floor, and there a-swooning was.</p>
<p>Up start our Alison and Nicholas,</p>
<p>And cry ‘Help!’ and ‘Succour!’ in the street.</p>
<p>The neighbours, the lesser and the great,</p>
<p>Came running in to gaze at this man,</p>
<p>Who swooning lay, both pale and wan,</p>
<p>For in the fall he broken had his arm.</p>
<p>But he had still to suffer all the harm,</p>
<p>For when he spoke, he was borne down,</p>
<p>By handsome Nicholas and Alison.</p>
<p>They told everyone that he was mad;</p>
<p>Afraid so, in a fantasy he had</p>
<p>Of Noah’s flood, that in his deep folly</p>
<p>He had bought him kneading-tubs three,</p>
<p>And had hung them from the roof above,</p>
<p>And had begged them, for God’s love,</p>
<p>To sit there in the roof for company.</p>
<p>The folk begin to mock his fantasy;</p>
<p>Up into the roof they gaze and stare;</p>
<p>And turn all his hurt to jest right there.</p>
<p>For whatsoever the carpenter averred</p>
<p>It was for naught; no man his story heard.</p>
<p>And with great oaths he was so put down</p>
<p>He was considered mad throughout the town,</p>
<p>For the clerks all said to one another.</p>
<p>‘The man is mad, for sure, my dear brother!’</p>
<p>And everybody laughed at all this strife.</p>
<p>And thus was had the carpenter’s wife,</p>
<p>For all his jealousy and keeping by;</p>
<p>And Absalon has kissed his nether-eye,</p>
<p>And Nicholas is scalded on the bum.</p>
<p>God save us all, and now this tale is done!</p>

<p>When folk had laughed at this preposterous clash</p>
<p>Twixt Absolon and handsome Nicholas,</p>
<p>Different folk it differently relayed,</p>
<p>But for the most part they laughed for days;</p>
<p>Nor at this tale did I see any grieve</p>
<p>Except perhaps for Oswald the Reeve.</p>
<p>In that carpentry was his own craft,</p>
<p>His heart indeed was left somewhat wrath;</p>
<p>He began to fret, and grumbled for a bit.</p>
<p>‘And I,’ quoth he, ‘could pay you back for it,</p>
<p>With how they threw dust in the miller’s eye,</p>
<p>If ribaldry was what I wished to ply!</p>
<p>But I am old; a jest suits not my age.</p>
<p>Green days are done; and straw’s my forage.</p>
<p>This white head proclaims my aged years;</p>
<p>My heart is as wasted as my hairs,</p>
<p>Unless I too am like the medlars –</p>
<p>The longer the fruit lasts the worse</p>
<p>It is, till rotten, in the dung and straw.</p>
<p>And we old men, I fear, are similar:</p>
<p>Till we be rotten we cannot be ripe.</p>
<p>We jig about as long as men will pipe;</p>
<p>For our will hangs always by this nail,</p>
<p>To have a hoary head and green tail,</p>
<p>As a leek has; and though our strength is gone,</p>
<p>Our will seeks folly ever and anon.</p>
<p>For though we cannot act as we say;</p>
<p>Yet in our ashes old the fire is raked.</p>
<p>‘Four live coals we have, let me advise:</p>
<p>Boasting, anger, greed and telling lies.</p>
<p>These four sparks old age will feel.</p>
<p>Our old limbs to impotence may yield,</p>
<p>But will shall not fail; and that’s the truth.</p>
<p>And even I have still a colt’s tooth,</p>
<p>However many years ago, now gone</p>
<p>My tap was drawn, life’s flow began.</p>
<p>For surely, when I was born, anon</p>
<p>Death drew life’s stopper and it ran on;</p>
<p>And ever since then has the tap so run</p>
<p>That almost empty now is the tun,</p>
<p>The stream of life is drops upon the rim. </p>
<p>The foolish tongue may well chime and ring</p>
<p>With idiocies that long ago we saw!</p>
<p>Old, all except for dotage is no more.’</p>
<p>Our Host, on hearing this sermoning,</p>
<p>Began to speak, as lordly as a king,</p>
<p>Saying: ‘What’s it amount to, all this wit?</p>
<p>What! Shall we speak all day of holy writ?</p>
<p>The devil makes a Reeve that’s fit to preach,</p>
<p>As from a cobbler a mariner, or a leech!</p>
<p>Speak out your tale, and waste no more the time.</p>
<p>Lo, here’s Deptford, an hour or so it’s nine!</p>
<p>Lo, Greenwich too, a rascal in every inn!</p>
<p>It’s high time to tell your tale, so begin.’</p>
<p>‘Now sirs,’ quoth this Oswald the Reeve,</p>
<p>I pray you all that none of you may grieve</p>
<p>Though I replied, mocking him just now;</p>
<p>For lawful is it force to force should bow.</p>
<p>The drunken Miller has told us here</p>
<p>Of this beguiling of the carpenter,</p>
<p>Perhaps in scorn because I too am one.</p>
<p>And by your leave I’ll him repay anon,</p>
<p>In his own boorish language, no mistake.</p>
<p>And I pray to God his neck might break!</p>
<p>He sees a mote in my eye, or a stalk,</p>
<p>But no beam in his own, for all his talk.’</p>

<p>At Trumpington, not far from Cambridge,</p>
<p>There runs a brook, and over that a bridge,</p>
<p>And upon this brook there stands a mill;</p>
<p>And this the truth to you indeed I tell.</p>
<p>A miller was who lived there many a day.</p>
<p>Proud as a peacock, lively in his way,</p>
<p>He could pipe, and fish, mend nets to boot,</p>
<p>And turn cups on a lathe, wrestle and shoot.</p>
<p>At his belt he always wore a long blade,</p>
<p>Sharp-edged as any sword was ever made.</p>
<p>A knife he carried in his pouch and such;</p>
<p>Peril of his life, no man dared him touch.</p>
<p>A Sheffield dagger he had in his hose.</p>
<p>Round was his face and pug-shaped his nose;</p>
<p>As bald as a naked ape was his skull.</p>
<p>He was a market-swaggerer right full.</p>
<p>No man a hand on him dared ever lay,</p>
<p>Without the miller swearing he would pay.</p>
<p>A thief he was, as well, of corn and meal,</p>
<p>And cunning at it, ever a man to steal.</p>
<p>And known he was as Scornful Simkin.</p>
<p>A wife he had, who came of noble kin:</p>
<p>The parson of the town her father was.</p>
<p>He dowered her with many a pan of brass,</p>
<p>That Simkin to his blood allied might be.</p>
<p>She had been fostered in a nunnery.</p>
<p>For Simkin wished for no wife, so he said,</p>
<p>Unless she were a maid and well-bred,</p>
<p>To maintain his yeoman’s honour high.</p>
<p>And she was proud, pert as a magpie.</p>
<p>A full fair sight they made, those two;</p>
<p>On holidays before her he would troop,</p>
<p>With his hood’s tippet wound round his head,</p>
<p>And she came after in a gown of red,</p>
<p>And Simkin’s hose were of the same.</p>
<p>No one called her anything but ‘dame’;</p>
<p>None so bold that travelled by the way</p>
<p>Who with her dare banter or once play,</p>
<p>Unless he wanted to be slain by Simkin,</p>
<p>With his long knife, his dagger or bodkin.</p>
<p>For jealous folk are dangerous you know –</p>
<p>At least they want their wives to think them so.</p>
<p>And since her origin implied some breach,</p>
<p>As filled with pride as water fills a ditch,</p>
<p>And full of scorn, disdain, her ready sneer.</p>
<p>A lady she thought should stay aloof, and glare,</p>
<p>Given her education and her family,</p>
<p>For she had been well taught in the nunnery.</p>
<p>A daughter they had between the two</p>
<p>Of twenty years, but none other though,</p>
<p>Save a child that was half a year in age;</p>
<p>In his cradle he lay, and was a proper page.</p>
<p>The wench quite plump and well-grown was,</p>
<p>With pug-shaped nose and eyes grey as glass,</p>
<p>With buttocks broad and breasts round and high;</p>
<p>But right fair was her hair, I will not lie.</p>
<p>The parson of the town, since she was fair,</p>
<p>Intended that she should be the heir</p>
<p>To his property and house and carriage;</p>
<p>And he was worried about her marriage.</p>
<p>His purpose was to wed her nobly</p>
<p>Into some blood of high ancestry,</p>
<p>For Holy Church’s goods must be expended</p>
<p>On Holy Church’s blood, well-descended.</p>
<p>Therefore he would his holy blood honour,</p>
<p>Though Holy Church he might well devour.</p>
<p>A fine trade this miller had, without doubt,</p>
<p>In wheat and malt from all the land about.</p>
<p>And especially there was a great college</p>
<p>Men called Solar Hall, and that in Cambridge;</p>
<p>Their wheat and their malt too he ground.</p>
<p>And one fine day the hour came around</p>
<p>The manciple lay sick with malady;</p>
<p>And men thought he would die, surely.</p>
<p>At which the miller stole both meal and corn</p>
<p>And took a hundred times more than before;</p>
<p>For formerly he stole, and yet politely,</p>
<p>While now he thieved outrageously:</p>
<p>Of this the warden made a great affair,</p>
<p>But not a jot the miller did he care;</p>
<p>He blustered, and swore it was not so.</p>
<p>Now two young students, poor I vow,</p>
<p>Dwelt there in the college hall, and they</p>
<p>Were headstrong and keen to joke and play,</p>
<p>And simply out of mirth and revelry,</p>
<p>They ever begged the warden busily,</p>
<p>To give them leave, to travel out of town,</p>
<p>And, to the mill, to see their corn ground,</p>
<p>And boldly they wagered him their neck,</p>
<p>They would not let the miller steal a peck</p>
<p>Of corn by force or cunning he might weave;</p>
<p>And in the end the warden gave them leave.</p>
<p>John was the one, and Alan was the other;</p>
<p>From the same village, that was Strother,</p>
<p>Far in the north – I cannot tell you where.</p>
<p>This Alan all his gear did prepare,</p>
<p>And on a horse the sack he threw anon.</p>
<p>Off went Alan the clerk, and also John,</p>
<p>With good sword and buckler by their side.</p>
<p>John knew the way – he required no guide –</p>
<p>And at the mill down the sack he laid.</p>
<p>Alan spoke first: ‘All hail, Simon, i’faith!</p>
<p>How fares your fair daughter and your wife?’</p>
<p>‘Alan, welcome,’ quoth Simkin,’ by my life!</p>
<p>And John also; how now, what do you here?’</p>
<p>‘By God,’ quoth John, ‘Necessity’s no peer;</p>
<p>He must serve himself that has no servant,</p>
<p>Or else he is a fool, as the scholars rant.</p>
<p>Our manciple, I think will soon be dead,</p>
<p>So painful are the molars in his head.</p>
<p>And I have come, and Alan here, we twain,</p>
<p>To grind our corn, and bear it home again.</p>
<p>I pray you speed us hither if you may.’</p>
<p>‘It shall be done,’ quoth Simkin, ‘by my faith!</p>
<p>What will you do while all that is in hand?’</p>
<p>‘By God, right by the hopper shall I stand,’</p>
<p>Quoth John, ‘and watch how the corn goes in.</p>
<p>I’ve never yet seen, by my father’s kin,</p>
<p>The hopper when it’s wagging to and fro.’</p>
<p>Alan replied: ‘John and will you so?’</p>
<p>Then I’ll stand beneath, by my crown,</p>
<p>And watch how the meal trickles down</p>
<p>Into the trough; that shall be my sport.</p>
<p>For John, i’faith, I am of your sort;</p>
<p>I am as little a miller as you may be.’</p>
<p>The miller smiled at their simplicity,</p>
<p>And thought, ‘All this will only last a while,</p>
<p>They think that nobody can them beguile.</p>
<p>But, by my thrift, I’ll hoodwink them, you see,</p>
<p>For all their cunning in philosophy.</p>
<p>The more clever tricks they undertake,</p>
<p>The more will I steal when I take;</p>
<p>Instead of flour yet I’ll give them bran.</p>
<p>The greatest scholar’s not the wisest man –</p>
<p>As the wolf once said to the mare.</p>
<p>And all their art I count it not a hair!’</p>
<p>Out at the door he goes all secretly,</p>
<p>When he sees his chance, and quietly.</p>
<p>He looks up and down till he has found</p>
<p>The scholars’ horse, tied there, around</p>
<p>Behind the mill, in a leafy dell.</p>
<p>And to the horse he goes fair and well;</p>
<p>He strips the bridle off right anon,</p>
<p>And once the horse is loose, he’s gone</p>
<p>To the fen, and the wild mares therein</p>
<p>Off with a ‘whinny’ through thick and thin.</p>
<p>The miller went back to work; and no word spoke,</p>
<p>Then, toiling, with the clerks he cracked a joke</p>
<p>Till their corn was fair and fully ground.</p>
<p>And when the meal was sacked and bound,</p>
<p>John goes out and finds his horse away,</p>
<p>And starts to cry ‘a thief’ and ‘well-away!’</p>
<p>‘Our horse is lost! Alan, for Gods’ bones,</p>
<p>Up on your feet! Come on, man, at once!</p>
<p>Alas, our warden of his palfrey’s shorn;</p>
<p>Thus Alan all forgot the meal and corn;</p>
<p>All his husbandry fled from his mind.</p>
<p>‘What, where is he?’ He began to cry.</p>
<p>The wife came running up, just then</p>
<p>Said: ‘Alas, your horse is off to the fen</p>
<p>To the wild mares, as fast as he can go.</p>
<p>A curse be on the hand that bound him so,</p>
<p>And he that better should have tied the rein!’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth John, ‘Alan, for Christ’s pain,</p>
<p>Lay down your sword, and I will mine also.</p>
<p>I am as swift, God knows, as any roe;</p>
<p>By God’s heart, he’ll not escape us both!</p>
<p>You should have put him in the barn, though.</p>
<p>Curse it, Alan, you’re the stupid one!’</p>
<p>These foolish clerks full fast have run</p>
<p>Toward the fen, both Alan and our John.</p>
<p>And when the miller saw that they were gone,</p>
<p>Half a bushel of their flour he did take,</p>
<p>And bade his wife go knead it in a cake.</p>
<p>He said: ‘Whatever it was the clerks feared</p>
<p>Yet can a miller clip a clerk’s beard,</p>
<p>For all his cunning; let them go their way!</p>
<p>Look how the horse goes; let the children play!</p>
<p>They’ll not catch him quickly, by my crown.’</p>
<p>Those foolish clerks go running up and down,</p>
<p>With: ‘Halt, halt! Stand, stand! Ware, behind!</p>
<p>You go whistle, and I’ll stop him, mind!’</p>
<p>But briefly, till the very fall of night</p>
<p>They could not, though they tried all they might,</p>
<p>Catch their horse, he always ran so fast;</p>
<p>Till in a ditch they caught him at the last.</p>
<p>Weary and wet, as the beast is on the rein,</p>
<p>Come foolish John, and Alan back again.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth John, ‘the day that I was born!</p>
<p>Now are we fit for mockery and scorn.</p>
<p>Our corn is stolen; men fools will us call,</p>
<p>Both the warden and our fellows all,</p>
<p>And especially the miller, well-away!’</p>
<p>So John moaned as he went on his way</p>
<p>Towards the mill, Bayard’s rein in hand.</p>
<p>The miller sitting by the fire he found,</p>
<p>For it was night, too late now for aught;</p>
<p>But for the love of God they him besought</p>
<p>For lodging, and their ease, for a penny.</p>
<p>The miller answered them: ‘If there be any,</p>
<p>Such as it is, you shall have your part.</p>
<p>My house is little, but you have learning, art;</p>
<p>You can by argument create a place</p>
<p>A mile wide from twenty foot of space!</p>
<p>Let us see now if this place may suffice,</p>
<p>Or make more room with speech, if you be wise.’</p>
<p>‘Now Simon,’ said our John, ‘by Saint Cuthbert,</p>
<p>You’re ever witty, and that’s a fair answer.</p>
<p>I’ve heard say, men should make of a thing,</p>
<p>Such as they find it, or their own should bring.</p>
<p>But especially I pray you, my host so dear,</p>
<p>Bring us some meat and drink, make some cheer,</p>
<p>And we will pay you truly and in full.</p>
<p>With empty hands men lure no hawks at will;</p>
<p>Lo here’s our silver, ready for us to spend.’</p>
<p>The miller in his turn his daughter sends</p>
<p>For ale and bread, and roasts them a goose,</p>
<p>And ties their horse; it shall no more go loose.</p>
<p>And in his own chamber makes them a bed,</p>
<p>With sheets and woollen blankets fairly spread,</p>
<p>Not ten foot from his own bed, or twelve.</p>
<p>His daughter had a bed all to herself,</p>
<p>In the same chamber, right nearby.</p>
<p>He could do no better, and for why?</p>
<p>There was no other room in the place.</p>
<p>They supped and talked, for a space,</p>
<p>And drank strong ale, the very best;</p>
<p>About midnight went they to their rest.</p>
<p>Well has this miller filled full his head;</p>
<p>All pale he was with drink, no longer red;</p>
<p>He hiccups and he talks through his nose,</p>
<p>As if he were hoarse or suffers from a cold.</p>
<p>To bed he goes and with him goes his wife;</p>
<p>She was merry as a jay, on my life,</p>
<p>So was her merry whistle well wet.</p>
<p>The cradle at the bed’s foot is set,</p>
<p>To rock and to give the child suck.</p>
<p>And when they had drunk all in the crock,</p>
<p>To bed went the daughter right anon.</p>
<p>To bed goes Alan and also John;</p>
<p>Of sleeping-draught they’d drunk a pail.</p>
<p>The miller had so heavily tippled ale</p>
<p>That like a horse he snorts in his sleep;</p>
<p>Nor from his tail behind a note does keep.</p>
<p>His wife sang him the burden, full and strong;</p>
<p>Men might hear her from a full furlong.</p>
<p>The wench snored too, for company.</p>
<p>Alan the scholar, heard this melody,</p>
<p>Poked at John, and said: ‘Sleepest, thou?</p>
<p>Heard thou ever such a song ere now?’</p>
<p>Lo, what a compline sing them all!</p>
<p>A wildfire on their very bodies fall!</p>
<p>Who ever heard such frightful snoring?</p>
<p>Yes, they shall meet the worst of endings!</p>
<p>This long night through I’ll find no rest.</p>
<p>Yet no matter; all shall be for the best!</p>
<p>For John,’ said he, ‘as I may ever thrive,</p>
<p>If I can I’ll have that wench alive.</p>
<p>Some compensation law has shown us;</p>
<p>For John, there is a law that says thus:</p>
<p>That if a man in some way be aggrieved,</p>
<p>Then by another he shall be relieved.</p>
<p>Our corn is stolen – none can say nay –</p>
<p>And we have had a right unlucky day;</p>
<p>Yet since there’s no rectification</p>
<p>Of my loss, I’ll have compensation.</p>
<p>By God’s soul, no otherwise shall it be!’</p>
<p>Then John replied: ‘Alan, wary be.</p>
<p>The miller is a dangerous man,’ he said,</p>
<p>‘If he wakes from sleeping like the dead,</p>
<p>He might do us both a villainy.’</p>
<p>Alan answered: ‘I count him not a flea.’</p>
<p>And up he rose, and to the wench he crept.</p>
<p>The wench lay flat on her back, and slept,</p>
<p>Till he so nigh was, ere she might espy,</p>
<p>That it was far too late for her to cry;</p>
<p>And briefly to explain, they soon made one.</p>
<p>Now play, Alan, for I will speak of John.</p>
<p>Our John lies still, a minute more or so,</p>
<p>And to himself he speaks words of woe.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth he, ‘this is a wicked jape!</p>
<p>Now I see that I am made but an ape.</p>
<p>My friend has something yet for his harm:</p>
<p>He has the miller’s daughter in his arms.</p>
<p>He took his chance and now his needs are sped,</p>
<p>While I lie like a bag of chaff in bed.</p>
<p>And when the joke is told another day,</p>
<p>I shall be thought a fool and afraid!</p>
<p>I’ll rise and chance my arm, by my faith!</p>
<p>“Unmanly is unlucky”, so men say.’</p>
<p>And up he rose and silently he went</p>
<p>Up to the cradle, with this same intent,</p>
<p>Of carrying it quietly to his bed’s foot.</p>
<p>Soon after this, the miller’s wife was up,</p>
<p>Half-awake, and going for a piss,</p>
<p>On her return the cradle she did miss,</p>
<p>And groping here and there, she found it not.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth she, ‘I very nearly got</p>
<p>By mistake into the scholar’s bed.</p>
<p>Oh, benedicite, then had I been misled!’</p>
<p>And off she went till she the cradle found.</p>
<p>Then she groped still further with her hand</p>
<p>And found the bed, and thought it good</p>
<p>Because the cradle beside it stood,</p>
<p>And knowing not, because it was so dark</p>
<p>Fair and well crept in there with the clerk,</p>
<p>And lay quite still, and would have gone to sleep.</p>
<p>In a while John the clerk he made a leap,</p>
<p>And on this good wife he laid on sore.</p>
<p>So good a bout she’d never gone before;</p>
<p>He thrust hard and deep as he were mad,</p>
<p>And a merry time those two students had</p>
<p>Till the third cock began to sing.</p>
<p>Alan was growing weary towards morning,</p>
<p>For he had laboured on through the dark,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Farewell, Molly, my sweetheart!</p>
<p>The day is come; I may no longer bide.</p>
<p>But evermore, wherever I go or ride,</p>
<p>I am your own clerk, may I prosper well!’</p>
<p>‘Now, dear lover,’ quoth she, ‘go, farewell!</p>
<p>But ere you go, one thing I must tell:</p>
<p>As you travel home and pass the mill,</p>
<p>Right at the entrance of the door behind</p>
<p>A cake of half a bushel you will find</p>
<p>That was made from your own meal,</p>
<p>That I helped my father for to steal.</p>
<p>And, good lover, God thee save and keep!’</p>
<p>And with that word she nigh began to weep.</p>
<p>Alan rose and thought, ‘before night’s end,</p>
<p>I’ll go and creep in beside my friend.’</p>
<p>And found the cradle with his hand anon.</p>
<p>‘By God,’ thought he, ‘I near went wrong!</p>
<p>My head’s so dizzy with all this tonight</p>
<p>That I’ve almost failed to go aright.</p>
<p>By the cradle, my mistake I know,</p>
<p>Here lies the miller and his wife also.’</p>
<p>And off he went, the devil led the way,</p>
<p>To the bed where the sleeping miller lay.</p>
<p>Hoping to creep in with his friend John;</p>
<p>Beside the miller he’s crept anon,</p>
<p>Caught him by the neck, and starts to say:</p>
<p>‘You John, you swine’s-head, come, awake,</p>
<p>For Christ’s soul, here’s a noble game!</p>
<p>For by that lord that’s called Saint James,</p>
<p>Thrice have I in this one short night</p>
<p>Had the miller’s daughter bolt upright,</p>
<p>While you, like a coward, lay afraid.’</p>
<p>‘Have you,’ quoth the miller, ‘false knave?</p>
<p>Oh, false traitor, false clerk,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘I’ll see you dead, by God’s dignity!</p>
<p>Who dares be so bold as to disparage</p>
<p>My daughter, come of such a lineage?’</p>
<p>And by the throat he caught our Alan,</p>
<p>And Alan in turn grabbed at his man,</p>
<p>And on the nose he smote with him fist.</p>
<p>Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast,</p>
<p>Onto the floor, nose and teeth they broke,</p>
<p>They thrashed about like two pigs in a poke.</p>
<p>And up they went, and down again anon,</p>
<p>Till the miller stumbled on a stone,</p>
<p>And down he fell backward on his wife,</p>
<p>Who knew nothing of this foolish strife,</p>
<p>For she had fallen asleep ere dawning light,</p>
<p>With John the clerk who was awake all night.</p>
<p>And with the miller’s fall she woke afraid;</p>
<p>‘Help, holy cross of Bromholm!’ she said.</p>
<p>‘In manas tuas! Lord, I call to thee!</p>
<p>Awake, Simon, for the fiend is on me!</p>
<p>My heart is broken; help, I am dead!</p>
<p>There’s something on my belly and head.</p>
<p>Help, Simkin, for the false clerks fight!’</p>
<p>Then John starts up as quick as ever he might,</p>
<p>And gropes around the walls to and fro,</p>
<p>To find a stick, and she starts up also,</p>
<p>And knows the place better than does John,</p>
<p>And by the wall a staff she finds anon,</p>
<p>And sees a little shimmering of light,</p>
<p>For at a hole in shone the moon bright;</p>
<p>And by that light she sees both the two,</p>
<p>But foolishly she sees not who was who,</p>
<p>But sees something white with her eye.</p>
<p>And when this white thing she did espy,</p>
<p>Thought it the clerk with a night-cap on,</p>
<p>And gripping the staff she crept upon</p>
<p>What she thought was Alan and hit him full,</p>
<p>But smote the miller on his bald skull</p>
<p>That down he goes, and cries, ‘God, I die!’</p>
<p>The clerks beat him well and let him lie,</p>
<p>Got them ready, and took their horse anon,</p>
<p>Their meal as well, and off they were gone,</p>
<p>And passing by the mill, found their cake</p>
<p>Of half a bushel of flour, and well-baked.</p>
<p>So the proud miller they did soundly beat,</p>
<p>And he has lost his grinding of the wheat,</p>
<p>And paid for the supper there as well,</p>
<p>Of Alan and John who wrought as I did tell;</p>
<p>His wife is had, and his daughter else.</p>
<p>Lo, what comes of being a miller false!</p>
<p>And therefore the proverb still proves true:</p>
<p>Don’t hope for good if you evil do.</p>
<p>A trickster himself beguiled will be.</p>
<p>And God, that sits in high majesty,</p>
<p>Save all this company, both great and small.</p>
<p>– Now my tale has paid the Miller and all.</p>


<p>The London Cook, as the Reeve’s tale hatched,</p>
<p>Wriggled as if his back were being scratched.</p>
<p>‘Ha, ha, ha!’ quoth he, ‘for Christ’s passion,</p>
<p>The Miller found that a harsh conclusion</p>
<p>To his argument about room-space!</p>
<p>Well said Solomon in his language:</p>
<p>‘Don’t let everyone inside your house.’</p>
<p>For lodging men by night is dangerous.</p>
<p>Well should a man think carefully</p>
<p>About who shall invade his privacy.</p>
<p>I pray to God, give me sorrow and care,</p>
<p>If, since they named me Roger of Ware,</p>
<p>I ever heard Miller so fooled for a lark,</p>
<p>A malicious trick and done in the dark!</p>
<p>But God forbid that we linger here:</p>
<p>And so, if you will vouchsafe to hear</p>
<p>A tale of mine, though a poor man,</p>
<p>I will tell you, as well as ever I can,</p>
<p>A little jest that befell in our City.’</p>
<p>Our Host replied and said: ‘I grant it thee.</p>
<p>Now tell on, Roger, look that it be good!</p>
<p>From many a pasty have you let blood,</p>
<p>And many a Jack of Dover pie have sold,</p>
<p>That has been twice hot and twice cold,</p>
<p>From many a pilgrim have had Christ’s curse,</p>
<p>Your parsley gave them a turn for the worse,</p>
<p>That they ate with your stubble-fed goose;</p>
<p>For there’s many a fly in your shop loose.</p>
<p>Now tell on, noble Roger, by name!</p>
<p>But I pray, no anger at my jesting game;</p>
<p>A man may speak truth in game and play.’</p>
<p>‘You speak truth,’ quoth Roger,’ by my faith!</p>
<p>But “True jest, poor jest”, as the Flemings say.</p>
<p>And so Harry Bailey, by your faith,</p>
<p>Be not angry, before we part from here,</p>
<p>If my tale be that of a hosteller.</p>
<p>However I won’t tell it yet, I say,</p>
<p>But before we part, you shall be paid.’</p>
<p>And with that he laughed with loud cheer,</p>
<p>And told his tale, as you now will hear.</p>

<p>A prentice once there was dwelt in our City,</p>
<p>And of the guild of victuallers was he.</p>
<p>As gaily dressed as goldfinch in a copse;</p>
<p>Brown as a berry, a fine short chap he was,</p>
<p>With locks black, combed so elegantly.</p>
<p>Dance he could so well and friskily</p>
<p>That he was named Perkin Fun-Lover.</p>
<p>And he was as full of love and amour</p>
<p>As is the hive full of honey sweet;</p>
<p>Lucky the wench that with him might meet.</p>
<p>At every bridal day he’d sing and hop.</p>
<p>He loved the tavern better than the shop,</p>
<p>When there was any riding in Cheapside,</p>
<p>Out of the shop and thither he would hie;</p>
<p>Till that he might all the sight there glean</p>
<p>And have a dance as well, he’d not be seen.</p>
<p>And he gathered a company of his sort,</p>
<p>To jig and sing, and make such merry sport.</p>
<p>And there they would arrange to meet</p>
<p>To play at dice in such and such a street;</p>
<p>For was no prentice in the town alive</p>
<p>That could cast a fairer pair of dice</p>
<p>Than Perkin could; and he was ever free</p>
<p>At spending, in a place of privacy.</p>
<p>As his master found in trade affairs;</p>
<p>Since often times he found the till was bare.</p>
<p>For sure where there’s a prentice fun-lover</p>
<p>That haunts dice, debauchery or amour,</p>
<p>His master from his shop will pay the fee,</p>
<p>Though he play no part in the minstrelsy.</p>
<p>Theft and debauchery are interchangeable.</p>
<p>As well play all on cithern, as on fiddle,</p>
<p>Among the base, revel and honesty</p>
<p>Are at odds any day, as men may see.</p>
<p>This jolly prentice with his master good</p>
<p>Stayed till well nigh out of prentice-hood,</p>
<p>Ever was reprimanded soon and late,</p>
<p>And sometimes led revelling to Newgate.</p>
<p>But at last his master him bethought,</p>
<p>On a day when his accounts were wrought,</p>
<p>Of a proverb that speaks this very word:</p>
<p>‘Best toss a rotten apple from the hoard</p>
<p>Before it rot all the fruit that’s present.’</p>
<p>So goes it with a dissolute servant;</p>
<p>A lot less harm to let him go his ways,</p>
<p>Than ruin all the servants in the place.</p>
<p>Therefore his master gave him quittance,</p>
<p>And bade him go, with a ‘good riddance’!</p>
<p>And so the jolly prentice has to leave.</p>
<p>Now let him riot all night, as he please!</p>
<p>And as there’s accomplice for every thief,</p>
<p>To help him to lay waste and deceive</p>
<p>Any man he borrowed from or pilfered,</p>
<p>Anon he sent his clothing and his bed</p>
<p>Round to a friend of his own sort,</p>
<p>Who loved dice too and revel and sport,</p>
<p>And had a wife who solely for appearance</p>
<p>Kept a shop, but whored for sustenance.</p>

<p>Our Host saw well that the bright sun</p>
<p>The arc of his artificial day had run</p>
<p>The fourth part and half an hour and more,</p>
<p>And though he was not deeply versed in lore,</p>
<p>He knew that it was the eighteenth day</p>
<p>Of April, that is messenger to May,</p>
<p>And saw that the shadow of every tree</p>
<p>Was in its length the same in quantity</p>
<p>As was the body erect that produced it,</p>
<p>And therefore, from the shadow, his wit</p>
<p>Deduced that Phoebus, so clear and bright,</p>
<p>Was five and forty degrees in height,</p>
<p>And on that day, and in that latitude,</p>
<p>It was ten o’clock, he might conclude;</p>
<p>And suddenly he turned his horse about.</p>
<p>‘Lordings,’ quoth he, ‘I warn you all right now,</p>
<p>The fourth part of this day’s already gone.</p>
<p>Now, for the love of God and of Saint John,</p>
<p>Lose no time, as little as you may.</p>
<p>Lordings, time is wasting, night and day,</p>
<p>And steals from us, what with covert sleeping,</p>
<p>And what with negligence in our waking,</p>
<p>Like the stream that never returns again,</p>
<p>Descending from the mountain to the plain.</p>
<p>Seneca, and many a philosopher,</p>
<p>Mourn for time more than for gold in coffer;</p>
<p>‘For loss of wealth recovered it may be,</p>
<p>But loss of time consumes us,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>It will not come again, once sped,</p>
<p>No more than will Malkin’s maidenhead,</p>
<p>When she has lost it in her wantonness.</p>
<p>Let us not moulder thus in idleness!</p>
<p>Sir Man of Law’ quoth he, ‘yours be bliss,</p>
<p>Tell us a tale, as our agreement is.</p>
<p>You have submitted by your free assent,</p>
<p>To accept, in this affair, my judgement.</p>
<p>Acquit yourself now at my request;</p>
<p>Then shall you do your duty, with the best.’</p>
<p>‘Host,’ quoth he, ‘depardieux, I assent!</p>
<p>To break a pledge was never my intent.</p>
<p>A promise is a debt, and I would pay</p>
<p>All my debts; I can no fairer say.</p>
<p>For the laws a man makes in his might</p>
<p>He should obey himself, and that is right –</p>
<p>Thus says our text. Nonetheless, for certain,</p>
<p>I can right now no decent tale sustain</p>
<p>Such as Chaucer, though little skilled is he</p>
<p>In metre, and in rhyming craftily,</p>
<p>Has written, in such English as he can,</p>
<p>Of ancient times, known to many a man.</p>
<p>And if he has not told them, dear brother</p>
<p>In one book, he has told them in another.</p>
<p>He has written of lovers up and down</p>
<p>More than our Ovid himself had found</p>
<p>In his Heroides that are full old.</p>
<p>Why tell them again, since they are told?</p>
<p>In youth he spoke of Ceyx and Alcyon,</p>
<p>And after that has written of everyone,</p>
<p>Those noble wives and those lovers too.</p>
<p>Whoever reads his large volume through</p>
<p>That is called The Legend of Good Women,</p>
<p>There the large wounds wide are penned</p>
<p>Of Babylon’s Thisbe, and Lucretia,</p>
<p>Dido’s sword for Aeneas her lover,</p>
<p>The tree of Phyllis for her Demophon,</p>
<p>Deianira’s and Hermione’s moan</p>
<p>Ariadne’s and Hypsipyle’s,</p>
<p>The barren isle standing in the sea,</p>
<p>The drowned Leander for his Hero,</p>
<p>The tears of Helen, and then the woe</p>
<p>Of Briseis, and you, Laodamia;</p>
<p>The cruelty of the Queen, Medea –</p>
<p>The little children hanged in the hall,</p>
<p>For your Jason, who in love was false.</p>
<p>O Hypermnestra, Penelope, Alceste,</p>
<p>Your wifehood he commended with the best!</p>
<p>But certainly no word does he sample</p>
<p>Of the wicked Canace’s example,</p>
<p>Who loved her own brother sinfully.</p>
<p>Such cursed stories, they are not for me,</p>
<p>Nor that of Tyre’s Apollonius –</p>
<p>And how the cursed King Antiochus</p>
<p>Bereft his daughter of her maidenhead.</p>
<p>And is so terrible, that tale I read,</p>
<p>Where he hurls her to the pavement!</p>
<p>And therefore with deliberate intent,</p>
<p>Would never write in any of his sermons</p>
<p>Of such unnatural abominations,</p>
<p>Nor will I retell them, though I may.</p>
<p>But what shall I do for a tale today?</p>
<p>I’m loath to be likened, you see,</p>
<p>To Muses men call the Pierides –</p>
<p>The Metamorphoses shows what I mean.</p>
<p>But nonetheless I care not a bean,</p>
<p>Though I come after him with poor man’s bake.</p>
<p>I’ll speak in prose, let him the rhymes make.’</p>
<p>And with a serious expression here</p>
<p>Began his tale, as you shall after hear.</p>


<p>O hateful harm, condition of poverty,</p>
<p>With thirst, with cold, with hunger, so confounded!</p>
<p>To ask for help shames your heart wretchedly;</p>
<p>If you ask none, so sore then are you wounded</p>
<p>That very need discovers all your wound hid.</p>
<p>Despite your need, you must for indigence</p>
<p>Steal or beg, or borrow your subsistence.</p>

<p>You blame the Christ, and say full bitterly</p>
<p>He misdirects our riches temporal.</p>
<p>Your neighbour you blame sinfully,</p>
<p>And say you have too little, and he has all.</p>
<p>‘By faith,’ you say, ‘judgement someday will fall,</p>
<p>And his tail shall burn in the fire indeed</p>
<p>For he the needy helped not in their need!’</p>

<p>Hark to the opinion of the wise:</p>
<p>‘Better to die than live in indigence.</p>
<p>Your very neighbour will you despise.’</p>
<p>If you be poor, respect for you flies hence!</p>
<p>Yet from the wise man hear this sentence:</p>
<p>‘All the days of poor men are wretched.’</p>
<p>Beware then, ere there you make your bed.</p> 

<p>If you are poor, your brother hates you too,</p>
<p>And all your friends flee from you, alas!</p>
<p>O rich merchant, full of wealth are you!</p>
<p>O noble, o prudent folk, as is your case!</p>
<p>Your bag’s not filled by throwing double ace,</p>
<p>But six and five that fall to you by chance.</p>
<p>At Christmas-tide merrily may you dance!</p>

<p>You seek o’er land and sea for your winnings.</p>
<p>As wise folk you know the certain state</p>
<p>Of kingdoms; are the fathers of tidings</p>
<p>And tales, both of peace and fierce debate.</p>
<p>I were now of tales right desolate,</p>
<p>But that a merchant, of another year,</p>
<p>Taught me a tale, one that you now shall hear.</p>


<p>In Syria once there dwelt a company</p>
<p>Of merchants rich, both dignified and true,</p>
<p>That far and wide despatched their spicery,</p>
<p>Their cloth of gold and satins rich of hue,</p>
<p>Merchandise of such quality, brand new,</p>
<p>That every one was happy to trade there</p>
<p>With them, and sell them all their wares.</p>

<p>Now it happened that merchants of this sort</p>
<p>Decided that to Rome their way they’d wend.</p>
<p>Whether for business dealings or for sport,</p>
<p>They wished no other messenger to send,</p>
<p>But go to Rome themselves did so intend.</p>
<p>And in such place as they thought pleasing</p>
<p>For their purpose, settle on their lodging.</p>
<p>The merchants had sojourned in that town</p>
<p>A certain time, as their pleasure chanced.</p>
<p>And so befell that the excellent renown</p>
<p>Of the Emperor’s daughter, Dame Constance,</p>
<p>Reported was, with every circumstance,</p>
<p>To these Syrian merchants in such wise,</p>
<p>From day to day, as I shall you advise.</p>
<p>This was the common voice of every man:</p>
<p>‘Our Emperor of Rome, God save thee!</p>
<p>A daughter has, that since the world began,</p>
<p>Reckoning both her goodness and her beauty,</p>
<p>There was never such another one as she.</p>
<p>I pray that God in honour keep her green,</p>
<p>And would she were of all Europe the queen!</p> 
<p>In her there is high beauty without pride,</p>
<p>Youth, without frivolity or folly;</p>
<p>In all her works virtue is her guide;</p>
<p>Humility has conquered vanity.</p>
<p>She is the mirror of all courtesy;</p>
<p>Her heart the chamber is of holiness,</p>
<p>Her hand, the medium of all largesse.’</p>
<p>And all these words were just, as God is true;</p>
<p>But to our purpose let us turn again.</p>
<p>These merchants their ships had freighted new,</p>
<p>And after they had seen this blessed maid,</p>
<p>Home to Syria they gladly sailed,</p>
<p>And ran their trade as they had done before,</p>
<p>And lived in wealth; I can say no more.</p>
<p>Now it befell these merchants stood in grace</p>
<p>With him that was the Sultan of Syria;</p>
<p>For when they returned from foreign place,</p>
<p>He would, of his benevolence and care,</p>
<p>Make them good cheer so he might share</p>
<p>Tidings of sundry kingdoms, and have word</p>
<p>Of wonders that they might have seen or heard.</p>
<p>Among other things, especially,</p>
<p>The merchants told him of Dame Constance</p>
<p>Her nobleness, in earnest, so minutely,</p>
<p>That thought of her the Sultan did entrance</p>
<p>And kept her image so in his remembrance</p>
<p>That all his delight and care was for</p>
<p>The love of her, while life might endure.</p> 
<p>Peradventure, in that immense book</p>
<p>Men call the heavens, it written was</p>
<p>In stars, since upon our birth they look,</p>
<p>That love would be the death of him, alas!</p>
<p>For in the stars, clearer than in glass,</p>
<p>Is written, God knows, for us to read</p>
<p>Each man’s death as it must come to be.</p>
<p>In stars many a winter long before</p>
<p>Was written the death of Hector, Achilles,</p>
<p>Of Pompey, Caesar, ere they were born;</p>
<p>The strife of Thebes, and of Hercules,</p>
<p>Of Samson, Turnus, and of Socrates</p>
<p>The death; but men’s wits are so dull,</p>
<p>That no man can read of it all in full.</p>
<p>This Sultan for his privy council sent,</p>
<p>And briefly through this matter to pace,</p>
<p>He declared to them his whole intent,</p>
<p>And said, unless he might have the grace</p>
<p>To win Constance within a little space,</p>
<p>He was but a dead man, bade them see</p>
<p>If they could find for him some remedy.</p>
<p>Diverse men diverse words then said;</p>
<p>They discussed it, argued up and down.</p>
<p>Many a subtle reason forth they led;</p>
<p>They spoke of magic and deception.</p>
<p>But finally, resolved in conclusion</p>
<p>That they could see no clear advantage</p>
<p>In any other course, except in marriage.</p> 
<p>But therein they saw such difficulty,</p>
<p>Reasoning like this, to make all plain,</p>
<p>Because there was such great diversity</p>
<p>Between their laws, one must maintain</p>
<p>They said ‘no Christian prince would deign</p>
<p>Wed his daughter by the laws as set</p>
<p>And taught us by Mahomet, our prophet.’</p>
<p>And he replied: ‘Rather than I should lose</p>
<p>Constance, I would be christened, no less.</p>
<p>I must be hers; I may no other choose.</p>
<p>I pray you, these thoughts no more express;</p>
<p>Save my life, and show no idleness</p>
<p>In gaining her who can kill me or cure,</p>
<p>For in this woe I cannot long endure.’</p>
<p>What need for greater explanation?</p>
<p>I say, by treaties and diplomacy,</p>
<p>And also by the Pope’s mediation,</p>
<p>And all the Church, and all the chivalry,</p>
<p>Bent on destroying Islam and heresy,</p>
<p>And spreading the law of Christ dear,</p>
<p>They all agreed, such as you shall hear:</p>
<p>How that the Sultan and his baronage</p>
<p>And all his lieges should christened be,</p>
<p>And he should have Constance in marriage,</p>
<p>And certain gold – I know not what quantity;</p>
<p>Be found as sufficient security.</p>
<p>This same accord was sworn on either side.</p>
<p>Now, fair Constance, may God be your guide!</p> 
<p>Some might expect me to tell, I guess,</p>
<p>Of all the preparations in advance</p>
<p>That the Emperor, in his nobleness,</p>
<p>Made for his daughter, Dame Constance.</p>
<p>Yet men will know that such an instance</p>
<p>Cannot be described in some little clause,</p>
<p>As was displayed in all that noble cause.</p>
<p>Bishops were appointed to attend,</p>
<p>Lords, ladies, knights of high renown,</p>
<p>And other folk enough – to this end.</p>
<p>And it is notified to all the town</p>
<p>That everyone of true devotion</p>
<p>Should pray to Christ that He this marriage</p>
<p>Might favour in His sight, and speed its passage.</p>
<p>The time is come for her departure –</p>
<p>I say the woeful fatal day is come,</p>
<p>That there she may no longer linger,</p>
<p>And forth to go were ready all and some.</p>
<p>Constance, who was with sorrow overcome,</p>
<p>Full pale arose, and dressed herself to go,</p>
<p>For well she knows it must indeed be so.</p>
<p>Alas, what wonder is it if she wept,</p>
<p>On being sent to a foreign nation,</p>
<p>Far from friends whose company she’d kept,</p>
<p>And then be bound in absolute subjection</p>
<p>To someone, knowing not his predilection?</p>
<p>Husbands are all good men, as known before</p>
<p>By all good wives – I dare say nothing more.</p> 
<p>‘Father,’ she said, ‘your wretched child Constance,</p>
<p>Your young daughter used to life so soft,</p>
<p>And you, my mother, of delight the instance</p>
<p>Above all things, except for Christ aloft,</p>
<p>Constance your child commends herself oft</p>
<p>To your grace, for I go to Syria,</p>
<p>And I lose you from my sight forever.</p>
<p>Alas, unto that barbarous nation</p>
<p>I must anon, since it is your will!</p>
<p>But Christ, that died for our redemption,</p>
<p>So give me grace his purpose to fulfil.</p>
<p>I, wretched woman, any can me kill.</p>
<p>Women are born to servitude and penance,</p>
<p>And to be kept within man’s governance.’</p>
<p>I think in Troy, when Pyrrhus breached the wall,</p>
<p>And Ilium burnt, or in Thebes the city,</p>
<p>Or Rome, when harm was done by Hannibal,</p>
<p>Who vanquished the Romans times three,</p>
<p>Never were heard such tender tears, for pity,</p>
<p>As were heard in her room at her departing!</p>
<p>But forth she must, whether she weep or sing.</p>
<p>O Primum Mobile, cruel firmament!</p>
<p>That drives all on in your diurnal sway</p>
<p>And hurls all from the east to occident</p>
<p>That naturally would run the other way,</p>
<p>Your driving set the heavens in such array</p>
<p>At the beginning of this fierce miscarriage</p>
<p>That cruel Mars had cursed the marriage.</p> 
<p>Unfortunate ascendant tortuous</p>
<p>Whose ruler now helpless falls, alas,</p>
<p>Out of his angle into the darkest house!</p>
<p>O Mars, O fatal chart, as this one was!</p>
<p>O feeble moon, unhappy in your course!</p>
<p>Positioned, where you are not well-received;</p>
<p>From where you would be so, cruelly heaved.</p>
<p>Imprudent Emperor of Rome, alas!</p>
<p>Was there no astrologer in all your town?</p>
<p>Was there no better day than this day was?</p>
<p>In journeying is there no decision</p>
<p>To be made for folk of high condition,</p>
<p>Even when their natal chart we know?</p>
<p>Alas, we are too ignorant or slow!</p>
<p>To ship is brought this woeful fair maid,</p>
<p>Solemnly, with royal circumstance.</p>
<p>‘Now Jesus Christ be with you all,’ she said.</p>
<p>Them there’s no more but: ‘Farewell, fair Constance!’</p>
<p>She strives to show a happy countenance;</p>
<p>And forth I let her sail now in this manner,</p>
<p>And turn I will again to my matter.</p>
<p>The Sultan’s mother, a well of vices,</p>
<p>Has understood her son’s full intent,</p>
<p>How he will forsake old sacrifices,</p>
<p>And right anon she for her council sent,</p>
<p>And they were made aware of her bent.</p>
<p>And when they were all assembled there,</p>
<p>She sat down, and spoke as you shall hear:</p> 
<p>‘Lords,’ quoth she, ‘you know, each and every one,</p>
<p>How my son is minded to forget</p>
<p>The holy laws proclaimed in our Koran,</p>
<p>Even by God’s messenger Mahomet.</p>
<p>But one vow to great God I make yet:</p>
<p>The life shall rather out of my body start,</p>
<p>Than Mahomet’s law from out my heart!</p>
<p>What can befall us from this new law</p>
<p>But thraldom to our bodies and grief,</p>
<p>And afterward to fall into Hell’s maw</p>
<p>Renouncing Mahomet, and our belief?</p>
<p>So lords, will you make pledge to me</p>
<p>In what I say, assenting to my course,</p>
<p>And I shall make us safe for evermore?</p>
<p>They swore and assented, every man,</p>
<p>To live and die for her, and by her stand,</p>
<p>And ever, in the best way that he can,</p>
<p>Support her with his friends throughout the land.</p>
<p>And she this enterprise takes in hand</p>
<p>Which you shall hear of as I devise,</p>
<p>And to them all she spoke and in this wise:</p> 
<p>‘We first shall feign their baptism to take –</p>
<p>Cold water will grieve us but a mite!</p>
<p>And I shall such a feast and revel make</p>
<p>That, I vow, the Sultan I’ll requite.</p>
<p>‘For, though his wife be christened never so white,</p>
<p>She shall have need to wash away the red,</p>
<p>Though she pour a font of water on her head.’</p>
<p>O Sultaness, root of iniquity,</p>
<p>Virago, Semiramis the second!</p>
<p>O serpent masked in femininity,</p>
<p>Like the serpent who in Hell is bound!</p>
<p>O feigning woman, all that may confound</p>
<p>Virtue and innocence, through your malice,</p>
<p>Is bred in you, the nest of every vice!</p>
<p>O Satan, envious since that day</p>
<p>When you were chased from our heritage,</p>
<p>You know well woman’s ancient way!</p>
<p>You made Eve bring us into bondage.</p>
<p>You will foredoom this Christian marriage.</p>
<p>Your instrument – well-away the while! –</p>
<p>You make of woman, whom you will beguile.</p> 
<p>This Sultaness, whom I blame and decry,</p>
<p>Let her council go quietly on their way.</p>
<p>Why should I in this tale longer tarry?</p>
<p>She rides to see the Sultan on a day,</p>
<p>And tells him she will renounce her faith,</p>
<p>And baptism at the priest’s hands undergone</p>
<p>Repent of being a heathen for so long,</p>
<p>Beseeching him to do her the honour,</p>
<p>Of asking the Christian folks to a feast.</p>
<p>‘To please them I will nobly labour.’</p>
<p>The Sultan said: ‘I accept at your behest,’</p>
<p>And, kneeling thanked her for her request.</p>
<p>So glad he was he knew not what to say.</p>
<p>She kissed her son, and home she went her way.</p>


<p>The Christian folk have reached the land</p>
<p>Of Syria, with a great solemn rout,</p>
<p>Swiftly a message left the Sultan’s hand</p>
<p>First to his mother, then to all about,</p>
<p>And said his wife was here, without doubt.</p>
<p>And asked her to ride and meet his Queen,</p>
<p>That his kingdom’s honour should be green.</p>
<p>Great was the throng and rich was the array</p>
<p>Of Syrians and Romans in that place.</p>
<p>The mother of the Sultan, rich and gay,</p>
<p>Received her also with as glad a face</p>
<p>As mother might her daughter there embrace.</p>
<p>And to the nearest city there beside</p>
<p>At a gentle pace they thither ride.</p> 
<p>I doubt that the triumph of Julius,</p>
<p>Of which Lucan makes such a boast</p>
<p>Was more royal or more curious</p>
<p>Than was the meeting of this splendid host.</p>
<p>But this scorpion, this wicked ghost,</p>
<p>The Sultaness, for all her flattering,</p>
<p>Planned in her heart full mortally to sting.</p>
<p>The Sultan himself arrived soon after this,</p>
<p>So royally, it was wonderful to tell.</p>
<p>He welcomes her with every joy and bliss.</p>
<p>And thus in mirth and joy I’ll let him dwell;</p>
<p>The fruit of this matter I must tell.</p>
<p>In due time, men thought it for the best</p>
<p>That revel ended, men went to their rest.</p>
<p>The day arrived, when this old Sultaness</p>
<p>Had ordained the feast of which I told,</p>
<p>And to the feast Christian folk addressed</p>
<p>Themselves, in general, both young and old.</p>
<p>Here may men feast and royalty behold,</p>
<p>And dainties more than I could so devise –</p>
<p>But all too dearly paid for ere they rise.</p>
<p>O sudden woe that ever is successor</p>
<p>To worldly bliss, mixed with bitterness!</p>
<p>The end of joy in all our earthly labour!</p>
<p>Woe occupies the bound of our gladness.</p>
<p>Hark to this counsel, such our auspices:</p>
<p>‘On the glad day bear it well in mind</p>
<p>That unknown woe or harm comes on behind.’</p> 
<p>For briefly for to tell, in a word,</p>
<p>The Sultan and the Christians every one</p>
<p>Were hacked to pieces, stabbed at the board,</p>
<p>Except for our Dame Constance alone.</p>
<p>The old Sultaness, that cursed crone,</p>
<p>Has with her friends done this cursed deed,</p>
<p>For she herself would all that country lead.</p>
<p>There was not one Syrian that converted,</p>
<p>No member of the Sultan’s council but</p>
<p>Was hewn to pieces, none had death averted.</p>
<p>And Constance have they taken now, hot-foot,</p>
<p>And in a ship all rudderless is she put,</p>
<p>God knows, and told to study how to sail</p>
<p>From Syria to Italy, calm or gale.</p>
<p>A certain treasure, brought with her, they add,</p>
<p>And, truth to tell, victuals in great plenty,</p>
<p>Were given her with the clothes she had;</p>
<p>And forth she sailed into the salt sea.</p>
<p>O my Constance, full of benignity,</p>
<p>O Emperor’s young daughter dear,</p>
<p>He that is lord of Fortune, shall you steer!</p>
<p>She crossed herself, and with full piteous voice,</p>
<p>Unto the cross of Christ thus spoke she:</p>
<p>‘O bright, o joyful altar, holy cross,</p>
<p>Reed of the Lamb’s blood, full of pity,</p>
<p>That wash the world of old iniquity,</p>
<p>Me from the fiend and his claws now keep,</p>
<p>That day that I shall drown in the deep!</p> 
<p>Victorious Tree, protection of the true,</p>
<p>Thou alone worthy were to bear</p>
<p>The King of Heaven, with His wounds new,</p>
<p>The white Lamb, that hurt was with a spear;</p>
<p>Driver of fiends from every him and her</p>
<p>Over whom your arms faithfully extend,</p>
<p>Protect and grant me strength my life to amend!’</p>
<p>For years and days driven was this creature</p>
<p>Through the seas of Greece, unto the strait</p>
<p>Of Morocco, her fate it was to adventure.</p>
<p>Of many a sorry meal now she ate!</p>
<p>On her death full often must she wait,</p>
<p>Ere that the wild waves shall her drive</p>
<p>To any shore whence succour might arrive.</p>
<p>Men might ask why then she was not slain</p>
<p>At the feast itself? Who did her body save?</p>
<p>And I reply to that demand again,</p>
<p>Who saved Daniel in the dreadful cave,</p>
<p>Where every man save he, master and knave,</p>
<p>Was eaten by lions before he could depart?</p>
<p>No one but God, whom he bore in his heart.</p>
<p>God wished to show a wondrous miracle</p>
<p>In her, for us to see how great his work is.</p>
<p>Christ, that is remedy for every fickle</p>
<p>Act of fate, by means that learned clerics</p>
<p>Know of, does many a thing that full dark is</p>
<p>To Man’s wit, and in our ignorance</p>
<p>We cannot know His careful providence.</p> 
<p>Now, since she was not drenched in gore,</p>
<p>What kept her then from drowning in the sea?</p>
<p>Well, who kept Jonah in the whale’s maw,</p>
<p>Till he was spouted up in Nineveh?</p>
<p>Men must know that it was none but He</p>
<p>That kept the Hebrew people from drowning,</p>
<p>With dry feet through the Red Sea passing.</p>
<p>Who bade the four spirits of the tempest,</p>
<p>That have the power to trouble land and sea,</p>
<p>Both north and south, and also east and west,</p>
<p>‘Trouble not the waves, nor land nor tree’?</p>
<p>Truly, of that the commander was He</p>
<p>That from the tempest ever this woman kept,</p>
<p>As well when she awoke as when she slept.</p>
<p>What meat and drink for her then on the wave</p>
<p>Three years and more beyond the sight of sail?</p>
<p>Who fed Mary of Egypt in the cave</p>
<p>Or the desert? No one but Christ, sans fail.</p>
<p>Five thousand folk were in a greater tale</p>
<p>On loaves five and fishes two to feed.</p>
<p>God sent his plenty in hour of need.</p>
<p>She is driven out into our ocean</p>
<p>Through the wild sea, till at the last</p>
<p>Below a castle, known to no man,</p>
<p>Far in Northumberland, she was cast.</p>
<p>And in the sand her vessel stuck so fast</p>
<p>That it remained from turn to turn of tide;</p>
<p>The will of Christ was that she should abide.</p> 
<p>The Constable of the castle came there</p>
<p>To see the wreck, and in the vessel sought,</p>
<p>And found this weary woman full of care;</p>
<p>He found also the treasure that she brought</p>
<p>In her own language mercy she besought,</p>
<p>The life out of her body fate to win,</p>
<p>And deliver her from the woe that she was in.</p>
<p>A sort of degenerate Latin was her speech,</p>
<p>But nevertheless he yet could understand.</p>
<p>This Constable, when nought was left to seek,</p>
<p>Brought this woeful woman to the land.</p>
<p>She knelt down, blessed God’s saving hand;</p>
<p>But as to who she was gave no reply,</p>
<p>For foul or fair, though she might die.</p>
<p>She said, she was confounded by the sea</p>
<p>Her memory was gone, in very truth.</p>
<p>And the Constable had for her such pity</p>
<p>And his wife too, that they wept forsooth.</p>
<p>She was so diligent, eager in her youth,</p>
<p>To serve and please all who were in that place</p>
<p>That all loved her who looked on her face.</p>
<p>The Constable, and Dame Hermengild his wife,</p>
<p>Were pagan, as was that country everywhere.</p>
<p>But Hermengild loved her as her life,</p>
<p>And Constance had so long sojourned there,</p>
<p>In orisons, with many a bitter tears,</p>
<p>Till Jesus converted through his grace</p>
<p>Dame Hermengild, the lady of the place.</p> 
<p>In all that land no Christians were about;</p>
<p>All Christian folk had fled the country,</p>
<p>For pagans had conquered, made a rout,</p>
<p>On all the northern shores, by land and sea.</p>
<p>To Wales had fled that Christianity</p>
<p>Of ancient Britons living in this isle;</p>
<p>There was its refuge for the meanwhile.</p>
<p>But Christian Britain was not so exiled</p>
<p>That there was not a few that secretly</p>
<p>Honoured Christ, and heathen folk beguiled;</p>
<p>And of such by the castle there lived three.</p>
<p>One of them was blind, and could not see</p>
<p>Except with the eyes within the mind,</p>
<p>With which men see when they are blind.</p>
<p>Bright was the sun on that summer’s day</p>
<p>On which the Constable and his wife also</p>
<p>And Constance had taken the direct way</p>
<p>Towards the sea, a furlong off or two,</p>
<p>To take their pleasure, roaming fro and to.</p>
<p>And on their walk this blind man they met,</p>
<p>Bent and old, with eyes fast shut and set.</p>
<p>‘In Christ’s name,’ cried out this blind Briton,</p>
<p>‘Dame Hermengild, give me my sight again!’</p>
<p>This lady grew fearful at the sound,</p>
<p>Lest her husband, briefly to explain,</p>
<p>Should for her love of Christ have her slain;</p>
<p>Till Constance made bold, and bade her work</p>
<p>The will of Christ, as daughter of his church.</p> 
<p>The Constable was troubled at the sight,</p>
<p>And said: ‘What means it then, this affair?’</p>
<p>Constance answered: ‘Sir, it is Christ’s might,</p>
<p>Who helps folks from out the foul fiend’s snare.’</p>
<p>And so our faith began she to declare,</p>
<p>Till she the Constable, before that eve,</p>
<p>Converted, and in Christ made him believe.</p>
<p>The Constable was not lord of this place</p>
<p>Where he found Constance on the sand,</p>
<p>But held it strongly, many winters’ space,</p>
<p>Under Alla, King of Northumberland,</p>
<p>That was full wise and strong of hand</p>
<p>Against the Scots, as men are aware.</p>
<p>But I turn now again to my matter.</p>
<p>Satan, that waits for us to beguile,</p>
<p>Saw of Constance all her perfection,</p>
<p>And cast about how he might her defile,</p>
<p>And made a young knight dwelling in that town</p>
<p>Love her so hotly, with a foul affection,</p>
<p>That truly he thought to die, or live until</p>
<p>He of her might once have had his will.</p>
<p>He wooed her then, but it availed him not –</p>
<p>She would not sin at all in any way.</p>
<p>And out of spite he plotted in his thought</p>
<p>A shameful death indeed for her, I say.</p>
<p>Waiting till the Constable was away,</p>
<p>Secretly upon a night he crept</p>
<p>Into Hermengild’s chamber while she slept.</p> 
<p>Wearied, with making of her orisons,</p>
<p>Constance sleeps, and Hermengild also.</p>
<p>This knight, through Satan’s temptations</p>
<p>All stealthily towards the bed does go,</p>
<p>And at once slits Hermengild’s throat,</p>
<p>And lays the bloody knife by Dame Constance</p>
<p>And goes his way – may God bring him mischance!</p>
<p>Soon after comes the Constable home again,</p>
<p>Along with Alla, that king was of those lands,</p>
<p>And saw his wife pitilessly slain,</p>
<p>At which full oft he wept and wrung his hands.</p>
<p>And in the bed the bloody knife he found</p>
<p>Beside Dame Constance. Alas, what could she say?</p>
<p>For very woe her wits went all astray.</p>
<p>To King Alla was told all this mischance,</p>
<p>And the time, and where, and in what wise</p>
<p>That in a ship was found this Dame Constance,</p>
<p>As before you have heard me advise.</p>
<p>The king’s heart melted in his eyes</p>
<p>When he saw so gentle a creature</p>
<p>Lost in suffering and misadventure.</p>
<p>For as the lamb towards its death is brought,</p>
<p>So stands this innocent before the king.</p>
<p>The false knight that has this treason wrought</p>
<p>Accuses her of doing this dark thing.</p>
<p>But nonetheless there was great mourning</p>
<p>Among the people, saying they would not guess</p>
<p>That she could do so great a wickedness.</p> 
<p>That they had ever seen her virtuous,</p>
<p>And loving Hermengild as her life,</p>
<p>Of this bore witness all in that house,</p>
<p>Save he that slew Hermengild with his knife.</p>
<p>The noble king heard far and wide</p>
<p>This testimony, and thought to enquire</p>
<p>Deep into this, and find the truth entire.</p>
<p>Alas, Constance, you have no champion,</p>
<p>Nor can you fight yourself, so well-away!</p>
<p>But he that died for our redemption</p>
<p>And bound Satan (who lies where he lay),</p>
<p>May He be your strong champion this day!</p>
<p>Unless Christ an open miracle display,</p>
<p>Guiltless you shall be slain without delay.</p>
<p>She fell upon her knees, and thus she said:</p>
<p>‘Immortal God, that did save Susanna</p>
<p>From calumny, and you, merciful maid,</p>
<p>Mary I mean, daughter of Saint Anna,</p>
<p>Before whose child angels sing Hosanna,</p>
<p>If I be guiltless of this felony,</p>
<p>My succour be, or else I shall die!’</p>
<p>Have you not seen sometimes a pale face</p>
<p>Among the throng, of him that has been led</p>
<p>Towards his death, having obtained no grace,</p>
<p>And such a hue over his face has spread,</p>
<p>Men might know his face as one in dread</p>
<p>Among all the faces there to be found?</p>
<p>So stands Constance, and gazes all around.</p> 
<p>O Queens, living in prosperity</p>
<p>Duchesses, and you ladies every one,</p>
<p>Take pity on her in adversity!</p>
<p>An Emperor’s daughter stands alone;</p>
<p>She has no one to whom to make her moan.</p>
<p>O blood royal, that stands in dread indeed,</p>
<p>Far off are your friends in your great need!</p>
<p>This King Alla had such compassion,</p>
<p>As noble heart is filled full of pity,</p>
<p>That from his eyes ran the water down.</p>
<p>‘Now swiftly go fetch a Book,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘And if this knight will swear that she</p>
<p>This woman slew, we will consider much</p>
<p>On whom we wish to nominate as judge.’</p>
<p>A British Book, in which were the Gospels,</p>
<p>Was fetched, and on this book he swore anon</p>
<p>She guilty was, it instantly befell</p>
<p>That a hand smote him on the neck-bone,</p>
<p>And down he fell lifeless as a stone,</p>
<p>And both his eyes burst from his face,</p>
<p>In sight of everybody in that place.</p>
<p>A voice was heard in general audience,</p>
<p>And said: ‘You have slandered the innocent,</p>
<p>A daughter of Holy Church in high presence.</p>
<p>So have you done, yet I remain silent!’</p>
<p>The throng was struck with amazement,</p>
<p>At this wonder, dumb stood every one</p>
<p>For fear of vengeance, save Constance alone.</p> 
<p>Great was the dread, and also the repentance,</p>
<p>Of those who had harboured false suspicion</p>
<p>Of the innocent and humble Constance.</p>
<p>And for this miracle, in conclusion,</p>
<p>And through Constance’s mediation,</p>
<p>The king, and many another in that place,</p>
<p>Converted were, thanks be to Christ’s grace!</p>
<p>The false knight had been slain in untruth</p>
<p>By judgement of Alla, instantly,</p>
<p>And yet Constance had pity for his youth.</p>
<p>And after this Jesus of his mercy</p>
<p>Made Alla marry full solemnly</p>
<p>This holy maid, who is so bright serene.</p>
<p>And so has Christ made Constance a queen.</p>
<p>But who was woeful, and I tell no lie,</p>
<p>At this wedding, but Donegild alone,</p>
<p>The king’s mother, full of tyranny?</p>
<p>She thought her cursed heart would break;</p>
<p>She wished her son had not done so.</p>
<p>She thought it an insult he should take</p>
<p>A foreign creature to be his mate.</p>
<p>Now I’d not wish from chaff and straw</p>
<p>To make so long a tale, but from good corn.</p>
<p>Why should I tell then of the wealth they pour</p>
<p>Out for the marriage, the course first borne,</p>
<p>Who blows upon the trumpet or the horn?</p>
<p>The fruit of every tale is but to say:</p>
<p>They eat and drink, and dance, and sing, and play.</p> 
<p>They went to bed, both reasonable and right,</p>
<p>For though wives are the holiest of things,</p>
<p>They must accept patiently at night</p>
<p>Such necessary customs as are pleasing</p>
<p>To folk that have wedded them with rings,</p>
<p>And lay their holiness somewhat aside</p>
<p>On such occasions – it cannot be denied.</p>
<p>He begat a boy child on her anon;</p>
<p>And to the Constable and Bishop he,</p>
<p>Gave his wife to guard when he was gone</p>
<p>To Scotland, there his enemies to seek.</p>
<p>Now fair Constance, who is so humble and meek</p>
<p>So far is gone with child, that calm and still</p>
<p>She lies in her chamber, abiding Christ’s will.</p>
<p>The time is come, a boy child she bears;</p>
<p>Mauricius at the font they him name.</p>
<p>The Constable summons a messenger,</p>
<p>And writes to his king, Alla, the same,</p>
<p>With blissful tidings how the child came</p>
<p>And other news expedient to say.</p>
<p>He takes the letter, and goes on his way.</p>
<p>This messenger, for his own advantage,</p>
<p>To the king’s mother swiftly rides,</p>
<p>And greets her full fair in this language:</p>
<p>‘Madame,’ quoth he, ‘you may be glad and blithe,</p>
<p>And thank God a hundred thousand times:</p>
<p>My lady has a child, of that no doubt,</p>
<p>To the joy and bliss of all the land about.</p> 
<p>Lo, here, these sealed letters speak the thing,</p>
<p>Which I must bear with all the haste I may.</p>
<p>If you have aught for your son the king,</p>
<p>I am your servant, both night and day.’</p>
<p>Donegild answered: ‘Not at this time, nay.</p>
<p>But here tonight I would you’d take your rest;</p>
<p>Tomorrow will I tell you all the rest.’</p>
<p>The messenger drank deep of ale and wine,</p>
<p>And stolen were his letters secretly</p>
<p>Out of his box, while he slept like a swine.</p>
<p>And counterfeited was all subtly</p>
<p>Another letter, wrought all sinfully,</p>
<p>Unto the king addressed about the matter</p>
<p>From his Constable, as you’ll hear after.</p>
<p>The letter claimed the Queen delivered was</p>
<p>Of so horrible a fiendish creature</p>
<p>That in the castle none so stalwart was</p>
<p>To dare for any time there to endure.</p>
<p>The mother was an elf, peradventure</p>
<p>Come by charms or by sorcery,</p>
<p>And every soul hated her company.</p>
<p>Woe was the king with this letter plain,</p>
<p>But spoke to no one of his sorrows sore,</p>
<p>And on his own hand he wrote again:</p>
<p>‘Welcome what Christ sends for evermore</p>
<p>To me that am now learned in His lore!</p>
<p>Lord, welcome be your wish and action;</p>
<p>All mine is subject to your direction.</p> 
<p>‘Defend this child, though it be foul or fair,</p>
<p>And my wife also, till my home-coming.</p>
<p>Christ, when he wish, may send me an heir</p>
<p>More agreeable than this to my liking.’</p>
<p>This letter he sealed, privately weeping,</p>
<p>Which to the messenger was taken soon,</p>
<p>And off he goes; no more was to be done.</p>
<p>O messenger, filled full of drunkenness,</p>
<p>Strong is your breath, your limbs falter they,</p>
<p>And all your secrets you confess.</p>
<p>Your mind is gone, you chatter like a jay;</p>
<p>Your face altered features does display.</p>
<p>Where drunkenness reigns in the house</p>
<p>There is no counsel hid, have no doubt.</p>
<p>O Donegild, there’s no English of mine</p>
<p>Fit for your malice and your tyranny,</p>
<p>And therefore to the fiend I you resign;</p>
<p>Let him write further of your treachery!</p>
<p>Fie, human monster! – No, by God, I lie! –</p>
<p>Fie, fiendish spirit! For I dare say well,</p>
<p>Though you walk here, your spirit is in Hell.</p>
<p>The messenger comes from the King again,</p>
<p>And at the King’s Mother’s court alights,</p>
<p>And she worked his confidence to gain,</p>
<p>And pleased him in everything she might.</p>
<p>He drank and filled his belly till the night;</p>
<p>He slept then, and snored in every wise</p>
<p>Until the morning sun began to rise.</p> 
<p>Again were his letters stolen every one,</p>
<p>And counterfeit letters penned like this:</p>
<p>‘The King commands his Constable anon,</p>
<p>On pain of hanging and severe justice,</p>
<p>That he should in no manner suffer his</p>
<p>Wife Constance in the land, she to abide</p>
<p>Three days more, and the quarter of a tide;</p>
<p>But in the same ship where she was found,</p>
<p>Her and her young son and all her gear</p>
<p>He should set, and thrust her from the land,</p>
<p>And charge her to nevermore come here.’</p>
<p>O my Constance, well may your spirit fear,</p>
<p>And sleeping, in your dream, feel the pangs,</p>
<p>When Donegild decrees this ordinance!</p>
<p>The messenger that morrow, when he woke,</p>
<p>Hastened to the castle the nearest way,</p>
<p>And to the Constable he the letter took.</p>
<p>And seeing what this sad letter had to say,</p>
<p>Full often he said: ‘Alas!’ and ‘Well-away!’</p>
<p>‘Lord Christ,’ quoth he, ‘how may this world endure,</p>
<p>So full of sin is many a creature?</p>
<p>Almighty God, if it should be your will,</p>
<p>Since you are the true Judge, how can it be</p>
<p>That you will allow innocent blood to spill,</p>
<p>And wicked folk to reign in prosperity?</p>
<p>O good Constance, alas, so woe is me,</p>
<p>That I must be your tormentor, or pay</p>
<p>In shameful death; there is no other way.’</p> 
<p>Both young and old wept in that place,</p>
<p>When the King this cursed letter sent.</p>
<p>And Constance, with a deadly pale face,</p>
<p>On the fourth day to her ship she went.</p>
<p>Nevertheless with inward content</p>
<p>She bowed to Christ’s will, knelt on the sand,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Lord, welcome is your command!</p>
<p>He that has defended me from blame</p>
<p>While I was on the shore among you,</p>
<p>He will keep me from all harm and shame</p>
<p>On the salt sea, though I know not how.</p>
<p>As strong as ever He was, so is He now.</p>
<p>In Him I trust, and in His Mother dear,</p>
<p>Who is to me my sail, and He will steer.’</p>
<p>Her little child lay weeping in her arms,</p>
<p>And kneeling, piteously to him she said:</p>
<p>‘Peace, little son, I will do you no harm.’</p>
<p>With that her head-cloth she disarrayed,</p>
<p>And doffing it, over his eyes it laid,</p>
<p>And in her arms she lulled him full fast,</p>
<p>And up to Heaven her eyes she cast.</p>
<p>‘Mother,’ quoth she, and maiden bright, Marie,</p>
<p>True it is, that through woman’s frail intent</p>
<p>Mankind was ruined, and condemned was he,</p>
<p>For which your child was on the Cross rent.</p>
<p>Your blessed eyes witnessed His torment;</p>
<p>Thus is there no comparison between</p>
<p>Your woe, and any woe that man has seen.</p> 
<p>You saw your child slain before your eyes,</p>
<p>And yet now lives my little child, in faith.</p>
<p>Now lady bright, who hears all woeful cries,</p>
<p>You glory of womanhood, you fair maid,</p>
<p>You haven of refuge, bright star of day,</p>
<p>Pity my child, and in your gentleness</p>
<p>Pity the pitiful, in sore distress.</p>
<p>O little child, alas, what is your guilt</p>
<p>That never sinned as yet, can it be</p>
<p>That your harsh father shall have you killed?</p>
<p>O mercy, dear Constable,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘Let my little child dwell still with thee!</p>
<p>And if you dare not save him, fearing blame,</p>
<p>Yet kiss him once in his father’s name!’</p>
<p>With this she looked back towards the land,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Farewell, my husband, pitiless!’</p>
<p>And up she rose and walked across the sand</p>
<p>Towards the ship; her followed all the rest.</p>
<p>And ever she prayed her child to cry the less,</p>
<p>And took her leave, and with holy intent</p>
<p>She crossed herself, and into the ship she went.</p>
<p>Victualled fully was the ship, indeed</p>
<p>Abundantly for her, a longish space;</p>
<p>And other necessaries she would need</p>
<p>She had enough, praised be God’s grace!</p>
<p>May wind and weather bow to God’s face,</p>
<p>And bring her home! I can no other say</p>
<p>Than through the sea she sets out on her way.</p> 

<p>Alla the King comes home soon after this</p>
<p>Back to his castle, that of which I told,</p>
<p>And asks where his wife and child is.</p>
<p>The Constable at his heart turned cold,</p>
<p>And plainly all the matter he him told –</p>
<p>As you have heard; I cannot tell it better –</p>
<p>And showed the King his seal and the letter,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Lord, as you commanded me</p>
<p>On pain of death, so have I done, be certain.’</p>
<p>The messenger questioned was till he</p>
<p>Was forced to confess, blunt and plain,</p>
<p>From night to night in what place he had lain.</p>
<p>And thus by close and subtle enquiry</p>
<p>It was conceived from whom this harm might be,</p>
<p>The hand was revealed that letter wrote,</p>
<p>And all the venom of this cursed deed,</p>
<p>But in what manner, certainly I know not.</p>
<p>The outcome was this: that Alla, as is said,</p>
<p>His mother slew – that all might know instead</p>
<p>How, traitor, she had failed in her allegiance.</p>
<p>So ends old Donegild, cursed in all that land!</p>
<p>The sorrow that this Alla night and day,</p>
<p>Feels for his wife and for his child also,</p>
<p>There is no tongue that tell it may.</p>
<p>But now will I again to Constance go,</p>
<p>Who drifts about the sea, in pain and woe,</p>
<p>Five years or more, at Christ’s command,</p>
<p>Before her ship draws near to land.</p> 
<p>Below a heathen castle at long last,</p>
<p>Of which no name in my text I find,</p>
<p>Constance and her child the sea up-cast.</p>
<p>Almighty God, who saves all mankind,</p>
<p>Have Constance and her child in mind,</p>
<p>To fall now into heathen hands her doom,</p>
<p>At brink of death, as I shall show you soon.</p>
<p>Down from the castle to gaze on this sight</p>
<p>Came many a one, and found Constance;</p>
<p>But shortly, from the castle in the night</p>
<p>The lord’s steward – God curse him at a glance! –</p>
<p>A thief that abjured our faith, did prance,</p>
<p>Came to the ship alone and said he should</p>
<p>Lie with her, no matter if she would.</p>
<p>The wretched woman then was woebegone;</p>
<p>Her child cried, and she cried piteously.</p>
<p>But blessed Mary helped her right anon;</p>
<p>For with her struggling hard and fiercely</p>
<p>The thief fell overboard, and suddenly</p>
<p>Was drowned beneath the sea, in vengeance,</p>
<p>And so Christ, undefiled keeps this Constance.</p>
<p>O foul lust and lechery, lo, your end!</p>
<p>Not only that you darken a man’s mind,</p>
<p>But truly you will his body take and rend.</p>
<p>The end of your work or passions blind</p>
<p>Is lamentation. How often men will find,</p>
<p>That not for the act, but for the intent</p>
<p>To commit the sin, they are killed or rent?</p> 
<p>How could this frail woman have the strength</p>
<p>To defend herself against this renegade?</p>
<p>O Goliath, immeasurable in length,</p>
<p>How has David your might un-made,</p>
<p>And he so young, in armour un-arrayed?</p>
<p>How did he dare to gaze on your dread face?</p>
<p>Well can men see, it was but by God’s grace.</p>
<p>Who gave Judith courage or hardiness</p>
<p>To slay King Holofernes in his tent,</p>
<p>And deliver out of wretchedness</p>
<p>The people of God? I say it was meant,</p>
<p>And just as God a spirit of vigour sent</p>
<p>To them, and saved them from mischance,</p>
<p>So sent he might and vigour to Constance.</p>
<p>Forth goes her ship through the narrow mouth</p>
<p>Of Gibraltar and Ceuta, then, drifts away,</p>
<p>Sometimes west, sometimes north and south,</p>
<p>And sometimes east, for many a weary day.</p>
<p>Till Christ’s Mother – blessed be she always! –</p>
<p>Determines through her endless goodness</p>
<p>To make an end of all her heaviness.</p>
<p>Now let us turn from Constance for a throw,</p>
<p>And speak about the Roman Emperor,</p>
<p>Who out of Syria in letters came to know</p>
<p>Of the slaughter of Christians, and dishonour</p>
<p>Done to his daughter by a false traitor;</p>
<p>I mean the cursed wicked Sultaness,</p>
<p>Who had so many slain at the feast.</p> 
<p>At which the Emperor has sent anon</p>
<p>His Senator, with royal ordinance,</p>
<p>And other lords, God knows, many a one,</p>
<p>On the Syrians to take high vengeance.</p>
<p>They burn, slay, and bring them mischance</p>
<p>For many a day; but to make and end:</p>
<p>Homeward to Rome their way they wend.</p>
<p>This Senator returned in victory</p>
<p>To Rome, sailing full royally,</p>
<p>And met the ship adrift, so goes the story,</p>
<p>In which Constance sat so piteously.</p>
<p>He knew nothing of who she was, or why</p>
<p>She was in such state, nor would she supply</p>
<p>One word about her rank, though she should die.</p>
<p>He brought her back to Rome, and to his wife</p>
<p>He gave her, and her young son also,</p>
<p>And with the Senator she led her life.</p>
<p>Thus can Our Lady bring us out of woe,</p>
<p>Woeful Constance and many another so;</p>
<p>And long time she dwelled in that place,</p>
<p>Doing holy works ever, in her grace.</p>
<p>The Senator’s wife her own aunt was,</p>
<p>But for all that she knew her no more.</p>
<p>I will no longer tarry on the case,</p>
<p>But to Alla, of whom I spoke before,</p>
<p>Who weeps for his wife and sighs full sore,</p>
<p>I will return, and I will leave Constance</p>
<p>Under the Senator’s governance.</p> 
<p>King Alla, who had his mother slain,</p>
<p>Fell one day into such repentance</p>
<p>That, to tell you briefly, and explain,</p>
<p>To Rome he came, to do his penance,</p>
<p>And to obey the Pope’s ordinance</p>
<p>In high and low, and Jesus Christ besought</p>
<p>To forgive the wicked works he had wrought.</p>
<p>The news at once through the town was borne</p>
<p>That Alla the King came in pilgrimage,</p>
<p>By harbingers of him, that came before;</p>
<p>And so the Senator, as was his usage,</p>
<p>Rode out again, and many of his lineage,</p>
<p>As much to show his great magnificence</p>
<p>As to do any king a reverence.</p>
<p>Great welcome does this noble Senator</p>
<p>Show King Alla, and he to him also;</p>
<p>Each of them does the other great honour.</p>
<p>And so it befell, in a day or so,</p>
<p>This Senator to King Alla is to go</p>
<p>To dine, I will not lie, and thus briefly,</p>
<p>Constance’s son went in his company.</p>
<p>Some say the request came from Constance</p>
<p>That the Senator take the child to the feast.</p>
<p>I cannot tell every circumstance;</p>
<p>Be as it may, there he was at least.</p>
<p>But true it is, that at his mother’s behest</p>
<p>Before Alla, during the meal’s space,</p>
<p>The child stood, and gazed at the King’s face.</p> 
<p>King Alla in this child found a wonder,</p>
<p>And to the Senator he said anon:</p>
<p>‘Whose is that fair child standing yonder?’</p>
<p>I know not,’ quoth he, ‘by God and by Saint John!</p>
<p>A mother he has, but father had he none</p>
<p>That I know of’ – and briefly he unwound</p>
<p>The tale to Alla of how the child was found.</p>
<p>‘But God knows,’ said this Senator also,</p>
<p>‘So virtuous a being in my life</p>
<p>As she I never saw, nor heard of, no,</p>
<p>Of worldly women, whether maid or wife.</p>
<p>I dare well say she’d rather feel the knife</p>
<p>Through her breast than be a wicked woman;</p>
<p>No man could bring her to that condition.’</p>
<p>Now was this child as like to Constance</p>
<p>As it were possible for child to be.</p>
<p>And Alla has the face in his remembrance</p>
<p>Of Dame Constance, and on this mused he,</p>
<p>If that the child’s mother could chance to be</p>
<p>His wife, and secretly began to sigh,</p>
<p>And left the table swiftly as he might.</p>
<p>‘By my faith,’ quoth he, a ghost is in my head!</p>
<p>I must believe, by every rational judgement,</p>
<p>That in the salt sea my wife is dead.’</p>
<p>Yet after that he made this argument:</p>
<p>‘How do I know that Christ has not sent</p>
<p>My wife here by sea, as once was his intent</p>
<p>To bring her to my land from which she went?’</p> 
<p>And after noon, home with the Senator</p>
<p>Goes Alla, to pursue this wondrous chance.</p>
<p>The Senator does Alla great honour</p>
<p>And swiftly he sends for Constance.</p>
<p>But trust in this, it did not make her dance</p>
<p>When she knew the reason for this command,</p>
<p>Barely upon her feet could she stand.</p>
<p>Alla greeted his wife fair, when they met,</p>
<p>And wept so much it was pitiful to see;</p>
<p>For at the first look that on her he set</p>
<p>He knew in very truth that it was she.</p>
<p>And she for sorrow stood dumb as a tree,</p>
<p>So was her heart imprisoned by distress,</p>
<p>When she remembered all his harshness.</p>
<p>Twice she swooned before him in his sight,</p>
<p>He wept and sought her pardon piteously.</p>
<p>‘Now God,’ quoth he, ‘and all his saints bright,</p>
<p>As surely may on my soul have mercy</p>
<p>If of your harm not innocent am I</p>
<p>As is Maurice my son, so like in face –</p>
<p>Else the fiend may drag me from this place!’</p>
<p>Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain</p>
<p>Ere that their woeful hearts might have peace.</p>
<p>Great was the pity to hear him weep again,</p>
<p>Through which her woe would then increase.</p>
<p>I pray you all from labour me release;</p>
<p>I may not tell their woe until tomorrow –</p>
<p>I am too weary now to speak of sorrow.</p> 
<p>But finally, when all the truth men know,</p>
<p>That Alla was innocent of all her woe,</p>
<p>A hundred times to kissing do they go,</p>
<p>And such a bliss is there between the two</p>
<p>That save the joy that is eternal so,</p>
<p>None like it has been seen by any creature</p>
<p>Or ever will, while this world shall endure.</p>
<p>Then she prayed her husband humbly,</p>
<p>To help ease her long-troubled mind,</p>
<p>That he would beg her father especially,</p>
<p>That of his majesty he would incline</p>
<p>To vouchsafe with him someday to dine.</p>
<p>She begged him also he should in no way</p>
<p>Tell her father of this that she did say.</p>
<p>Some men say how that the child Maurice</p>
<p>Carried this message to the Emperor;</p>
<p>But, as I guess, Alla was not so foolish</p>
<p>As to send, to one of sovereign honour –</p>
<p>He that is of Christian folk the flower –</p>
<p>A child indeed; but wiser still I deem</p>
<p>For him to go himself, as it would seem.</p>
<p>The Emperor answered courteously</p>
<p>The dinner invitation as he besought;</p>
<p>And as I read here, he gazed intently</p>
<p>At this child, and of his daughter thought.</p>
<p>Alla goes to his inn, and as he ought</p>
<p>Arrays himself for the feast in every wise,</p>
<p>As perfectly as his skill might suffice.</p> 
<p>The morrow came, and Alla began to dress,</p>
<p>And his wife also, the Emperor to meet,</p>
<p>And off they ride in joy and gladness.</p>
<p>And when she saw her father in the street,</p>
<p>She alighted and fell down at his feet.</p>
<p>‘Father,’ quoth she, ‘your young child Constance</p>
<p>Is now clean lost from your remembrance.</p>
<p>‘I am your daughter Constance,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘That you once sent into Syria.</p>
<p>It is I, father, that in the salt sea</p>
<p>Was lost alone, and condemned to suffer.</p>
<p>Now father, have mercy on your daughter!</p>
<p>Send me no more into heathenness,</p>
<p>But thank my lord here for his kindness.’</p>
<p>Who can the merciful joy tell all</p>
<p>Betwixt those three, now they are met?</p>
<p>But of my tale make an end I shall;</p>
<p>The day goes fast, I will no longer let</p>
<p>Time slip: this glad folk to dinner sit;</p>
<p>In joy and bliss at dinner let them dwell,</p>
<p>A thousand-fold more than I can tell.</p>
<p>The child Maurice after was Emperor</p>
<p>Crowned by the Pope, in Christianity;</p>
<p>To Christ’s Church he did great honour.</p>
<p>But I let all his story fly from me;</p>
<p>Of Constance is my tale especially.</p>
<p>In the old Roman chronicles we find</p>
<p>Maurice’s life; I have it not in mind.</p> 
<p>King Alla, when there came the chosen day,</p>
<p>With his Constance, his holy wife so sweet,</p>
<p>To England they sailed the nearest way,</p>
<p>Where they lived in joy and in quiet.</p>
<p>But little while it lasted, I admit,</p>
<p>Joy of this world, since time will not abide;</p>
<p>From day to day it changes as the tide.</p>
<p>Who lived ever in such delight all day</p>
<p>That in him there moved no instance</p>
<p>Of anger, or desire, some kin’s affray,</p>
<p>Envy or pride, or passion, or offence?</p>
<p>I will only say to end this sentence,</p>
<p>But a little while in a joyful sense</p>
<p>Lasted the bliss of Alla and Constance.</p>
<p>For death takes of high and low his rent:</p>
<p>When a year had passed, even as I guess,</p>
<p>Life in this world for King Alla was spent,</p>
<p>At which Constance felt such great sadness.</p>
<p>Now let us pray that God his soul bless!</p>
<p>And Dame Constance, finally to say,</p>
<p>Towards the town of Rome goes her way.</p>
<p>To Rome, is come this holy creature,</p>
<p>And finds her friends there whole and sound;</p>
<p>Now escaped from all her adventures.</p>
<p>And when that she her father has found;</p>
<p>Down on her knees falls she to the ground;</p>
<p>Weeping for tenderness with heart blithe,</p>
<p>She praises God a hundred thousand times.</p> 
<p>In virtue and in holy alms’ deeds</p>
<p>They all live, and never asunder wend;</p>
<p>Till death parts them from this life they lead.</p>
<p>And fare well now, my tale is at an end.</p>
<p>Now Jesus Christ, in His might may He send</p>
<p>Joy after woe, and govern us in His grace,</p>
<p>And protect us all that are in this place! Amen.</p>

<p>Our Host upon his stirrups stood anon,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Good men, hearken everyone!</p>
<p>That was a nifty tale! All gold, no stones!</p>
<p>Sir Parish Priest,’ quoth he, ‘for God’s bones,</p>
<p>Tell us a tale, as you promised us before.</p>
<p>As I know well you men learned in lore</p>
<p>Are full of knowledge, by God’s dignity.’</p>
<p>The Parson answered: ‘Benedicitee!</p>
<p>What ails the man so sinfully to swear?’</p>
<p>Our Host answered, ‘O Jankin, are you there?</p>
<p>I smell a Lollard in the wind!’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘Now good men,’ quoth our Host, hark to me!</p>
<p>Abide, for God’s noble passion,</p>
<p>For we shall have – in preacher’s fashion –</p>
<p>This Lollard tell us piously what’s what.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, by my father’s soul, that shall he not!’</p>
<p>Said the Shipman, ‘Here shall he not preach.</p>
<p>He shall no gospel gloss for us, nor teach.</p>
<p>We live all in the great God’s eye,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘He would sow for us some difficulty,</p>
<p>Or scatter tares about in our clean corn.</p>
<p>And therefore, Host, I warn you before</p>
<p>My handsome body a fine tale shall tell,</p>
<p>And ring for you so merry a bell,</p>
<p>That I shall waken all this company.</p>
<p>But it shall not be of philosophy,</p>
<p>No physicus, no strange terms in law.</p>
<p>There is but little Latin in my maw!’</p>


<p>Experience, though no authority</p>
<p>Ruled in this world, would be enough for me</p>
<p>To speak of the woe that is in marriage.</p>
<p>For, lordings, since I twelve years was of age,</p>
<p>Thanks be to God who eternally does thrive,</p>
<p>Husbands at church-door have I had five –</p>
<p>If it be allowed so oft to wedded be –</p>
<p>And all were worthy men in their degree.</p>
<p>But I was told, for sure, and not long since,</p>
<p>That since Christ never went but once</p>
<p>To a wedding, in Cana of Galilee,</p>
<p>That by the same example He taught me</p>
<p>That I should only be wedded once.</p>
<p>Hark too, lo, what sharp words for the nonce</p>
<p>Beside a well, Jesus, God and Man,</p>
<p>Spoke in reproof of the Samaritan:</p>
<p>‘You have had five husbands,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘And that same man that now has thee</p>
<p>Is not your husband’ – so he said for certain.</p>
<p>What he meant by that, I can’t explain;</p>
<p>But I ask you why the fifth man</p>
<p>Was not husband of the Samaritan?</p>
<p>How many was she allowed in marriage?</p>
<p>I have never yet had despite my age</p>
<p>Of that number any definition.</p>
<p>Men may divine and gloss, up and down,</p>
<p>But well I know, indeed, without a lie,</p>
<p>God bade us all to wax and multiply.</p>
<p>That gentle text I well can understand!</p>
<p>And I know too He said that my husband</p>
<p>Should leave father and mother and cleave to me;</p>
<p>But of no number mention made He,</p>
<p>Of bigamy or of octogamy.</p>
<p>Why should men then speak of it evilly?</p>
<p>Lo, here, the wise King, old Solomon,</p>
<p>I think he had more wives than one!</p>
<p>As would to God it were permitted me</p>
<p>To be refreshed half so oft as he!</p>
<p>A gift of God had he of all those wives!</p>
<p>No man has such that’s in this world alive.</p>
<p>God knows, that noble king, as I see it,</p>
<p>The first night had many a merry fit</p>
<p>With each of them, so happy was his life!</p>
<p>Blessed be God, that I have wedded five,</p>
<p>And they I picked out from all the best,</p>
<p>Both for their nether purse and their chest.</p>
<p>Diverse schools make perfect clerks,</p>
<p>And diverse practice in many sundry works,</p>
<p>Makes the workman perfect, certainly.</p>
<p>Of five husbands have I made a study;</p>
<p>Welcome the sixth, whenever he befall!</p>
<p>Forsooth, I will not keep me chaste in all;</p>
<p>When my husband from this world is gone,</p>
<p>Some Christian man shall wed me anon.</p>
<p>For then the Apostle says that I am free</p>
<p>To wed, in God’s name, where it pleases me.</p>
<p>He says to be wedded is no sin, I learn:</p>
<p>‘Better to be wedded than to burn.’</p>
<p>What care I if folk speak maliciously</p>
<p>Of wicked Lamech and his bigamy?</p>
<p>I know that Abraham was a holy man,</p>
<p>And Jacob also, as far as ever I can,</p>
<p>And each of them had more wives than two,</p>
<p>And many another holy man had too.</p>
<p>Where can you show me, in any age</p>
<p>That God on high forbade our marriage</p>
<p>By express word? I pray you, tell it me.</p>
<p>Or where commanded he virginity?</p>
<p>I know as well as you, what he said,</p>
<p>The Apostle, when he spoke of maidenhead,</p>
<p>He said that precepts for it he had none.</p>
<p>Men may counsel a woman to live alone,</p>
<p>But counselling is no commandment;</p>
<p>He has left it to our own judgement.</p>
<p>For had God commanded maidenhood,</p>
<p>Then had he ended marriage and for good.</p>
<p>And surely, if there were never seed sown,</p>
<p>Virginity, where would that be grown?</p>
<p>Paul did not dare command, not in the least,</p>
<p>A thing of which his Master never preached.</p>
<p>The spear, the prize, is there of virginity;</p>
<p>Catch it who may, and who runs best let’s see!</p>
<p>But this word is not said of every wight,</p>
<p>Rather God’s pleased to grant it of his might.</p>
<p>I know well that the Apostle was a maid,</p>
<p>But nonetheless, though he wrote and said</p>
<p>He wished that everyone was such as He,</p>
<p>He was but counselling virginity,</p>
<p>And to be wife he still gave me leave</p>
<p>Of indulgence; so no reproof indeed,</p>
<p>If my husband die, in wedding me,</p>
<p>No objection on grounds of bigamy,</p>
<p>Though it were good no woman for to touch –</p>
<p>He meant in bed or on a couch or such –</p>
<p>For peril it is, fire and tow to assemble –</p>
<p>You know what this image does resemble!</p>
<p>The long and short: he held virginity</p>
<p>More perfect than marriage in frailty.</p>
<p>Frailty I say, unless the he and she</p>
<p>Would live all their life in chastity.</p>
<p>I grant it well, I would have no envy,</p>
<p>Though maidenhood devalue bigamy.</p>
<p>They like to be clean in body and ghost.</p>
<p>And of my state I will make no boast;</p>
<p>For you well know, a lord in his household</p>
<p>Has not ever vessel made all of gold.</p>
<p>Some are of wood, and do good service.</p>
<p>God calls folk in sundry ways like this,</p>
<p>And everyone has from God his own gift,</p>
<p>Some this, some that, as is in His wish.</p>
<p>Virginity is a great perfection</p>
<p>And continence also with devotion.</p>
<p>But Christ, of perfection is the well,</p>
<p>And bade not everyone to go and sell</p>
<p>All that he had, and give it to the poor,</p>
<p>And in that guise follow him, for sure.</p>
<p>He spoke to those who would live perfectly;</p>
<p>And, lordings, by your leave, that is not me!</p>
<p>I will bestow the flower of my age</p>
<p>On the actions and the fruits of marriage.</p>
<p>Tell me then, to what end and conclusion</p>
<p>Were made the members of generation,</p>
<p>And in so perfect wise Man was wrought?</p>
<p>Trust me right well, they were not made for naught.</p>
<p>Gloss as you will and give the explanation</p>
<p>That they were made merely for purgation</p>
<p>Of urine, and both our things, so the tale,</p>
<p>Made but to know the female from the male,</p>
<p>And for no other purpose – say you no?</p>
<p>Experience knows well it is not so.</p>
<p>So long as the clerics with me be not wrath,</p>
<p>I say this: that they are made for both –</p>
<p>That is to say, for office and for ease</p>
<p>Of procreation, that we not God displease.</p>
<p>Why else is it in the books clearly set</p>
<p>That a man shall pay his wife her debt?</p>
<p>Now wherewith should he make his payment,</p>
<p>If he did not use his blessed instrument?</p>
<p>Thus were they added to the creature</p>
<p>To purge urine, and continue nature.</p>
<p>But I do not say every wight is told</p>
<p>That has such tackle, as I unfold,</p>
<p>To go and use it to engender there –</p>
<p>Or men for chastity would have no care.</p>
<p>Christ was a maid, yet formed as a man,</p>
<p>And many a saint since the world began,</p>
<p>Yet lived they ever in perfect chastity.</p>
<p>I have no quarrel with virginity;</p>
<p>Of pure wheat-seed let them be bred,</p>
<p>And let us wives be dubbed barley-bread –</p>
<p>And yet with barley-bread, as Mark can</p>
<p>Remind you, Jesus fed full many a man.</p>
<p>In such a state as God has called us,</p>
<p>I will persevere; I am not precious.</p>
<p>In wifehood will I use my instrument</p>
<p>As freely as my Maker has it sent.</p>
<p>If I be niggardly, God give me sorrow!</p>
<p>My husband shall have it eve and morrow,</p>
<p>When he would come forth and pay his debt.</p>
<p>A husband I will have, I will as yet,</p>
<p>Who shall be both my debtor and my thrall,</p>
<p>And bear the tribulation withal</p>
<p>On his own flesh, while I am his wife.</p>
<p>I have the power during my whole life</p>
<p>Over his proper body, and not he.</p>
<p>Right thus the Apostle told it me,</p>
<p>And bade our husbands for to love us well;</p>
<p>On that saying I ever like to dwell.’</p>
<p>Up started the Pardoner, and that anon:</p>
<p>‘Now dame,’ quoth he, ‘by God and by Saint John,</p>
<p>You are a noble preacher in this cause!</p>
<p>I was about to wed a wife: I pause!</p>
<p>What! Should I pay, with my own flesh, so dear?</p>
<p>I’d rather wed no wife, then, any year!’</p>
<p>‘Abide,’ quoth she, ‘my tale’s not yet begun.</p>
<p>Nay, you will drink from a different tun,</p>
<p>Before I go, and savour worse than ale.</p>
<p>And when I have told you all my tale</p>
<p>Of tribulation in marriage,</p>
<p>In which I am an expert at my age –</p>
<p>That is to say, I have been the whip –</p>
<p>Then please yourself whether you wish to sip</p>
<p>Of this tun that I shall broach.</p>
<p>Beware of it, before a close approach!</p>
<p>For I shall give examples more than ten.</p>
<p>‘Whoever will not be warned by other men,</p>
<p>To other men shall an example be.’</p>
<p>These very words writes Ptolemy;</p>
<p>Read in his Almagest, and find them there.’</p>
<p>‘Dame, I would pray you, if it is your care,’</p>
<p>Said this Pardoner, ‘as you began,</p>
<p>Tell forth your tale; spare not any man,</p>
<p>And teach us young men of your practices.’</p>
<p>‘Gladly,’ quoth she, ‘if you it pleases.</p>
<p>But yet I ask of all this company,</p>
<p>If I should chance to speak out of whimsy,</p>
<p>Take no offence then at what I say,</p>
<p>For my intention is but to play.</p>
<p>Now sir, then will I tell you all my tale.</p>
<p>If ever I might drink of wine or ale,</p>
<p>I shall speak true: those husbands that I had</p>
<p>Three of them were good, and two were bad.</p>
<p>The three good men were rich and old.</p>
<p>With difficulty only could they hold</p>
<p>To the articles that bound them to me –</p>
<p>You know well what I mean by that, I see!</p>
<p>So help me God, I laugh when I think</p>
<p>That sad to say they never slept a wink.</p>
<p>And, by my faith, I set by it no store.</p>
<p>They gave me land and treasure more;</p>
<p>I had no need to show them diligence</p>
<p>To win their love, or do them reverence.</p>
<p>They loved me so well, by God above</p>
<p>I had no need to set store by their love.</p>
<p>A wise woman will busy herself anon</p>
<p>To win her love, yes, if she has none.</p>
<p>But since I held them wholly in my hand,</p>
<p>And since they had given me all their land,</p>
<p>Why should I be concerned to please,</p>
<p>Except for my own profit and my ease?</p>
<p>I set them so to work, by my faith,</p>
<p>That many a night they sang “well-away!”</p>
<p>But never for us the flitch of bacon though,</p>
<p>That some may win in Essex at Dunmow.</p>
<p>I ruled them so according to my law,</p>
<p>That each of them was blissful and in awe,</p>
<p>And brought me pretty things from the fair.</p>
<p>They were full glad when I spoke them fair,</p>
<p>For God knows, I chid them mercilessly.</p>
<p>Now hearken how to act properly.</p>
<p>You wise wives that will understand,</p>
<p>Put them ever in the wrong, out of hand,</p>
<p>For half so boldly there never was a man</p>
<p>Could swear oaths and lie as woman can.</p>
<p>I say this not for wives who are wise,</p>
<p>Unless it be when they are mis-advised.</p>
<p>A wise wife, if she knows good from bad,</p>
<p>Will call the chattering magpies merely mad,</p>
<p>And obtain the witness of her own maid</p>
<p>To what she asserts – listen how I played:</p>
<p>“Old sir dotard is this then your way?</p>
<p>Why is my neighbour’s wife dressed so gay?</p>
<p>She is honoured now wherever she goes;</p>
<p>I sit at home; and lacking decent clothes.</p>
<p>What are you doing at my neighbour’s house?</p>
<p>Is she so fair? Are you so amorous?</p>
<p>What do you whisper to the maid, benedicitee?</p>
<p>Old sir lecher, away with your trickery!</p>
<p>And if I have a gossip with a friend,</p>
<p>All innocently, you chide like the fiend</p>
<p>If I walk or wander to his house.</p>
<p>Yet you come home drunk as a mouse,</p>
<p>And preach from your chair, beyond belief!</p>
<p>You tell me, then, how it’s a great mischief</p>
<p>To wed a poor woman, the expense,</p>
<p>And then if she’s rich, of good descent,</p>
<p>Then you say it’s a torment, and misery</p>
<p>To endure her pride and melancholy.</p>
<p>And if she be fair, you proper knave,</p>
<p>You say that every lecher has his way</p>
<p>With her, since none in chastity abide,</p>
<p>When they are assailed from every side.</p>
<p>You say, that some desire us for our riches,</p>
<p>Some for our shapeliness, some for our fairness,</p>
<p>And some because we can sing or dance,</p>
<p>And some for gentleness and dalliance,</p>
<p>Some for our hands and arms so small –</p>
<p>By your word, thus to the devil go us all!</p>
<p>You say men never hold a castle wall,</p>
<p>If it is long laid siege to, it will fall.</p>
<p>And if she be foul, you say that she</p>
<p>Covets every man that she might see,</p>
<p>For like a spaniel she will at him leap</p>
<p>Till she finds some man to take her cheap;</p>
<p>Never a goose so grey swam on the lake</p>
<p>That, say you, it will not find a mate.</p>
<p>You say it’s a hard thing to control</p>
<p>What no man willingly will hold.</p>
<p>Thus say you, lord, on your way to bed,</p>
<p>And that no wise man ever needs to wed,</p>
<p>Nor no man that has his eye on Heaven –</p>
<p>Wild thunderbolts and lightning-fire then</p>
<p>Fall on your withered neck till it be broke!</p>
<p>You say that leaking roofs, and thick smoke,</p>
<p>And chiding wives can make men flee</p>
<p>From their own house – ah, benedicitee,</p>
<p>What ails the old man so to make him chide?</p>
<p>You say we wives will all our vices hide</p>
<p>Till we be wed, and then we show them you.</p>
<p>That may well be the saying of a shrew!</p>
<p>You say that oxen, asses, horse and hound,</p>
<p>Can be tried over every sort of ground,</p>
<p>Basins, bowls, before a man may buy;</p>
<p>Spoons, stools, and all such things we try,</p>
<p>And likewise pots, clothes, and finery,</p>
<p>But wives must remain a mystery</p>
<p>Till they be wedded, you old dotard shrew!</p>
<p>And then, we will our vices show, says you.</p>
<p>You say too that it displeases me</p>
<p>Unless you forever praise my beauty,</p>
<p>And every moment pore o’er my face,</p>
<p>And call me “fair dame” in every place,</p>
<p>And lay out for a feast upon the day</p>
<p>When I was born, and make me fresh and gay,</p>
<p>And do my old nurse every honour,</p>
<p>And my chambermaid in my bower,</p>
<p>And my father’s kin and his allies;</p>
<p>So say you, old barrel-full of lies!</p>
<p>And yet because of our apprentice, Jankin,</p>
<p>And his crisp hair, that shines as gold so fine,</p>
<p>And his squiring me both up and down,</p>
<p>You harbour false suspicion, as I found;</p>
<p>I would not want him if you died tomorrow!</p>
<p>But tell me this, why do you hide, a sorrow,</p>
<p>The keys of your chest away from me?</p>
<p>They are my goods as well as yours, pardee!</p>
<p>What, will you make an idiot of your dame?</p>
<p>Now, by that lord who is called Saint James,</p>
<p>You shall not both, whatever be your moods,</p>
<p>Be master of my body, and my goods.</p>
<p>One you shall forgo, so say I,</p>
<p>What need have you to enquire or spy?</p>
<p>I think you’d like to lock me in your chest!</p>
<p>You should say: “Wife, go where you wish.</p>
<p>Take your pleasure; I’ll believe no malice.</p>
<p>I know you for a true wife, Dame Alice.”</p>
<p>We love no man that keeps watch, takes charge</p>
<p>Of where we go; we wish to be at large.</p>
<p>Of all men the most blessed must be,</p>
<p>That wise astrologer, old Ptolemy,</p>
<p>That writ this proverb in his Almagest:</p>
<p>“Of all men his wisdom is the highest</p>
<p>That cares not who has this world in his hand.”</p>
<p>By this proverb you must understand,</p>
<p>If you’ve enough, why should you care</p>
<p>How merrily other folks do fare?</p>
<p>Be sure, old dotard, by your leave</p>
<p>You shall have all you wish at eve.</p>
<p>He is too great a niggard who will spurn</p>
<p>A man who wants a light from his lantern;</p>
<p>He will have no less light, pardee!</p>
<p>If you’ve enough, don’t complain to me.</p>
<p>You say too, if we make ourselves gay</p>
<p>With clothing, and with precious array,</p>
<p>It puts us in peril of our chastity.</p>
<p>And yet – curse it – you make free</p>
<p>With these words in the Apostle’s name:</p>
<p>“In clothing made of chastity and shame</p>
<p>You women shall adorn yourselves,” quoth he,</p>
<p>“And not with braided hair, or jewellery,</p>
<p>With pearls, or with gold, or clothes rich.”</p>
<p>According to your text, as your tricks,</p>
<p>I’ll not act, not as much as a gnat!</p>
<p>You said then, that I was like a cat,</p>
<p>For whosoever singes a cat’s skin</p>
<p>Then will the cat keep to his inn;</p>
<p>While if the cat’s skin be sleek and gay,</p>
<p>She’ll not dwell in that house half a day.</p>
<p>But out she’ll pad, ere any daylight fall,</p>
<p>To show her skin, and go and caterwaul.</p>
<p> That is to say, if I feel gay, sir shrew,</p>
<p>I’ll run and show my old clothes to the view.</p>
<p>Sir, old fool, what use to you are spies?</p>
<p>Though you beg Argus with his hundred eyes</p>
<p>To be my body-guard, since he best is,</p>
<p>In faith, he shall not if it’s not my wish.</p>
<p>Yet I will trim his beard, as I may thee!</p>
<p>Then you said that there are things three,</p>
<p>The which things trouble all this earth,</p>
<p>And that no man may endure the fourth –</p>
<p>Away, sir shrew, Jesus trim your life!</p>
<p>You preach again and say a hateful wife</p>
<p>Is reckoned to be one of these mischances.</p>
<p>Are there then no other circumstances</p>
<p>You could address your parables to,</p>
<p>Without a poor wife acting one for you?</p>
<p>You even liken woman’s love to Hell,</p>
<p>To barren land, where water may not dwell.</p>
<p>You liken it then, as well, to a wild fire:</p>
<p>The more it burns, the more it has desire</p>
<p>To consume everything that burnt can be.</p>
<p>You say, that just as insects kill a tree,</p>
<p>Just so a wife destroys her husband;</p>
<p>This they know who to a wife are bound.”</p>
<p>Lordings, like this it was, you understand,</p>
<p>I kept my older husbands well in hand</p>
<p>With what they said in their drunkenness;</p>
<p>And all was false, but I had witnesses</p>
<p>In Jankin, and in my niece also.</p>
<p>O Lord, the pain I did them and the woe,</p>
<p>Full innocent, by God’s sweet destiny!</p>
<p>For like a horse I could bite and whinny.</p>
<p>I could moan, when I was the guilty one</p>
<p>Or else I’d oftentimes been done and gone.</p>
<p>Who at the mill is first, first grinds their grain;</p>
<p>So was our strife ended: I did first complain.</p>
<p>They were right glad and quick to apologise</p>
<p>For things they never did in all their lives.</p>
<p>For wenching I would take the man in hand,</p>
<p>Though him so sick he could hardly stand.</p>
<p>Yet it tickled his heart, in that he</p>
<p>Thought I was fond of him as he of me.</p>
<p>I swore that all my walking out at night</p>
<p>Was just to spy on the wenches that I cite;</p>
<p>Flying that flag caused me many a mirth.</p>
<p>For all such wit is given us at birth;</p>
<p>Deceit, weeping, spinning, God gives</p>
<p>To woman by nature, while she lives.</p>
<p>And of one thing I can boast, you see:</p>
<p>I had the better of them in high degree,</p>
<p>By cunning, force, or some manner of thing,</p>
<p>Such as continual murmuring and grumbling.</p>
<p>And in bed especially they had mischance:</p>
<p>There was my chiding and remonstrance.</p>
<p>I would no longer in the bed abide,</p>
<p>If I felt his arm across my side,</p>
<p>Till he had paid his ransom to me;</p>
<p>Then would I let him do his nicety.</p>
<p>And therefore every man this tale I tell,</p>
<p>Win whosoever may, for all’s to sell!</p>
<p>With empty hand you will no falcon lure.</p>
<p>In winning would I all his lust endure,</p>
<p>And display a feigned appetite –</p>
<p>And yet in bacon I took no delight.</p>
<p>That was the cause ever I would them chide;</p>
<p>For though the Pope had sat down beside,</p>
<p>I would not spare them at their own board,</p>
<p>For, by my troth, I paid them word for word.</p>
<p>As may aid me God the Omnipotent,</p>
<p>Though I this minute make my testament,</p>
<p>I owe them not a word that was not quits!</p>
<p>I brought it about so by my wits</p>
<p>That they were forced to yield, for the best,</p>
<p>Or else we would never have found rest.</p>
<p>For though he might rage like a maddened lion,</p>
<p>Yet he would always fail in his conclusion.</p>
<p>Then would I say: “My dear, note how meek</p>
<p>The look that Willikin displays, our sheep!</p>
<p>Come here, my spouse, let me kiss your cheek.</p>
<p>You should be as patient, and as meek,</p>
<p>And have as sweet and mild a conscience,</p>
<p>Since you preach so much of Job’s patience.</p>
<p>Practice endurance ever that you preach;</p>
<p>And if you don’t then certainly I’ll teach</p>
<p>How fair it is to have a wife at peace.</p>
<p>One of us two must yield, at least,</p>
<p>And since a man is more reasonable</p>
<p>Than a woman, you should be tractable.</p>
<p>What ails you, to grumble so and groan?</p>
<p>Is it you would possess my sex alone?</p>
<p>Why, take it all; lo, have it every bit!</p>
<p>Saint Peter damn you if you don’t enjoy it!</p>
<p>For if I were to sell my belle chose,</p>
<p>I could go as fresh as is the rose;</p>
<p>But I will keep it for your own use.</p>
<p>By God, you are to blame, and that’s the truth.”</p>
<p>Such manner of words have we on hand.</p>
<p>Now will I speak of my fourth husband.</p>
<p>My fourth husband was a reveller;</p>
<p>That is to say, he kept a lover.</p>
<p>And I was young, and my spirits high,</p>
<p>Stubborn and strong, and pert as a magpie.</p>
<p>How I danced to the harp, without fail,</p>
<p>And sang, indeed, like any nightingale,</p>
<p>When I had drunk a draught of sweet wine.</p>
<p>Metellius, the foul churl, the swine,</p>
<p>That with a stick robbed his wife of life</p>
<p>For drinking wine, though I had been his wife</p>
<p>Would never have frightened me from drink!</p>
<p>And after wine on Venus I would think,</p>
<p>For as surely as cold engenders hail,</p>
<p>A gluttonous mouth gets a lecherous tail.</p>
<p>A drunken woman has no true defence;</p>
<p>This lechers know from their experience.</p>
<p>But, Lord Christ, whenever in memory</p>
<p>I recall my youth and all my jollity,</p>
<p>It tickles me about my heart’s root.</p>
<p>To this day it does my heart good,</p>
<p>That I have had the world, in my time.</p>
<p>But age, alas, that poisons every clime,</p>
<p>Bereft me of beauty, vigour with it.</p>
<p>Let go, farewell; and the devil take it!</p>
<p>The flour is gone, what more is there to tell.</p>
<p>The bran, as best I can, now I must sell.</p>
<p>But yet to be right merry, I have planned!</p>
<p>Now will I tell you of my fourth husband.</p>
<p>I say, I felt at heart a deal of spite</p>
<p>If he in any other took delight;</p>
<p>But he was paid, by God and Saint Judoc!</p>
<p>I made him of the same wood a crook –</p>
<p>Not of my body, in some foul manner,</p>
<p>But was such friends with folk, by and by,</p>
<p>That in his own grease I made him fry,</p>
<p>For anger, and for very jealousy.</p>
<p>By God, on earth I was his purgatory!</p>
<p>For which I hope his soul is in glory.</p>
<p>For, God knows, he sat full oft in song,</p>
<p>When his shoe pinched him all along.</p>
<p>There is none but God and he who knew</p>
<p>In how many ways I tortured him anew.</p>
<p>He died when I returned from Jerusalem,</p>
<p>And lies there buried under the rood-beam,</p>
<p>Albeit his tomb’s not so curious</p>
<p>As was the sepulchre of Darius,</p>
<p>That Apelles sculpted subtly;</p>
<p>It were a waste to bury him preciously.</p>
<p>May he fare well, God give his soul rest!</p>
<p>He is now in his grave and in his chest.</p>
<p>Now of my fifth husband will I tell.</p>
<p>God may his soul never come to Hell!</p>
<p>And yet to me he was the worst, I know –</p>
<p>I feel it on my ribs all in a row,</p>
<p>And ever shall, until my dying day.</p>
<p>But in our bed he was so fresh, I say,</p>
<p>And could cajole me so, God knows,</p>
<p>When that he would have my belle chose,</p>
<p>That though he’d beaten me on every bone,</p>
<p>He could still win my love to him anon.</p>
<p>I swear I loved him best, because he</p>
<p>Was in his love niggardly to me.</p>
<p>We women have, you’ll hear no lie from me,</p>
<p>In this affair a strange fantasy:</p>
<p>Whatever we may not easily get,</p>
<p>We cry all day and crave for it.</p>
<p>Forbid us aught, desire it then will we;</p>
<p>Press on us hard, and we will flee.</p>
<p>Reluctantly we show our goods at fairs;</p>
<p>Great crowds at market make for dear wares,</p>
<p>And what is cheap is held a worthless prize.</p>
<p>This knows every woman who is wise.</p>
<p>My fifth husband – God his soul bless! –</p>
<p>Whom I took for love, not for riches,</p>
<p>He sometime was a clerk of Oxford town,</p>
<p>And left the college, and seeking found</p>
<p>Lodgings with my friend, there made one –</p>
<p>God keep her soul! Her name was Alison.</p>
<p>She knew my heart, and my secrets she,</p>
<p>Better than our parish priest, trust me.</p>
<p>To her I revealed my secrets all;</p>
<p>For had my husband pissed against a wall,</p>
<p>Or done some crime that would cost his life,</p>
<p>To her, and to another worthy wife,</p>
<p>And to my niece, that I loved as well,</p>
<p>I would have told the secret, just to tell.</p>
<p>And so I did full often, God knows</p>
<p>It made his face full often like a rose,</p>
<p>Red hot for very shame, and sorry he</p>
<p>For telling me his secret privately.</p>
<p>And so befell it that one day in Lent –</p>
<p>For often to my friend’s house I went,</p>
<p>As ever yet I loved to laugh and play,</p>
<p>And to walk in March, April, and May,</p>
<p>To hear sundry tales among the alleys –</p>
<p>Jankin clerk, and I, and my friend Alice,</p>
<p>Into the fields about the city went.</p>
<p>My husband was in London all that Lent;</p>
<p>I had the greater leisure for to play,</p>
<p>And to see, and be seen, every day</p>
<p>By lusty folk. How did I know what grace</p>
<p>Might be my destiny, and in what place?</p>
<p>Therefore I made my visitations</p>
<p>Went to vigils, and also to processions,</p>
<p>To preaching too, and these pilgrimages,</p>
<p>To the miracle plays, and marriages,</p>
<p>And wore my gay scarlet as I might.</p>
<p>The worms, and the moths, and mites</p>
<p>Upon my soul, gnawed it never a bit;</p>
<p>And why? Well, I was never out of it.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you now what happened to me:</p>
<p>I say that in the fields around walked we,</p>
<p>Till truly we made such a dalliance,</p>
<p>This clerk and I, that at a chance</p>
<p>I spoke to him, and said to him that he,</p>
<p>If I became a widow, should marry me.</p>
<p>For certainly, with no false modesty,</p>
<p>I was never without a little surety</p>
<p>Of marriage, nor ever had far to seek.</p>
<p>I hold a mouse’s heart not worth a leek,</p>
<p>That only has one little hole to bolt to,</p>
<p>And if that fail, then everything is through.</p>
<p>I maintained he had enchanted me;</p>
<p>My mother taught me that subtlety.</p>
<p>And I said too, I dreamed of him all night;</p>
<p>He seemed to slay me as I lay upright,</p>
<p>And all my bed indeed was full of blood –</p>
<p>“But yet I hope that you will do me good,</p>
<p>For blood betokens gold as I was taught.”</p>
<p>And all was false; I never dreamed of aught,</p>
<p>But by way of following mother’s lore,</p>
<p>In things like that as well as others more.</p>
<p>But now, sir – let me see – what’s to explain?</p>
<p>Aha! By God, I have my tale again!</p>
<p>When my fourth husband was on his bier,</p>
<p>I wept for hours, and sorry did appear –</p>
<p>As wives must, since it’s common usage,</p>
<p>And with my kerchief covered up my visage.</p>
<p>But since I was provided with a mate,</p>
<p>I only wept a little, I should state.</p>
<p>To church was my husband borne that morrow,</p>
<p>With neighbours that wept for him in sorrow,</p>
<p>And Jankin, our clerk, was one of those.</p>
<p>So help me God, when I saw him go</p>
<p>After the bier, I thought he had a pair</p>
<p>Of legs and of feet so fine and fair,</p>
<p>That all my heart I gave to him to hold.</p>
<p>He was, I swear, but twenty winters old,</p>
<p>And I was forty, to tell the truth,</p>
<p>But yet I always had a coltish tooth.</p>
<p>Gap-toothed I was, and that became me well;</p>
<p>I’d the print of Venus’ seal, truth to tell.</p>
<p>So help me God, I was a lusty one,</p>
<p>And fair, and rich, high-spirited and young!</p>
<p>And truly, as my husbands told me,</p>
<p>I had the finest quoniam that might be.</p>
<p>For certain, I am all Venereal</p>
<p>In feeling, and my heart is Martial.</p>
<p>Venus gave me my lust, lasciviousness,</p>
<p>And Mars gave me rebellious boldness.</p>
<p>My ascendant Taurus, with Mars therein –</p>
<p>Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!</p>
<p>I always followed my inclination,</p>
<p>By virtue of my constellation.</p>
<p>It made me so I could never withhold</p>
<p>My chamber of Venus from a fellow bold.</p>
<p>Yet have I Mars’ mark upon my face,</p>
<p>And also in another private place.</p>
<p>For, God wisely be my salvation,</p>
<p>I never loved with any discretion,</p>
<p>But ever followed my appetite,</p>
<p>Whether he was long, or short, or black or white.</p>
<p>I cared not, so long as he liked me,</p>
<p>How rich he was, nor of what degree.</p>
<p>What can I say, but at the month’s end,</p>
<p>This jolly clerk Jankin, my godsend,</p>
<p>Wedded me with great solemnity,</p>
<p>And him I gave the land and property</p>
<p>All that had been given to me before.</p>
<p>But after I repented of it full sore;</p>
<p>He would allow me nothing I held dear.</p>
<p>By God, he smote me once on the ear,</p>
<p>Because I tore a page from his book,</p>
<p>So that my ear was deaf from the stroke.</p>
<p>Stubborn I was, as is a lioness,</p>
<p>And with a tongue nagging to excess,</p>
<p>And walk I would, as I had done before,</p>
<p>From house to house, something he deplored.</p>
<p>About which he often times would preach,</p>
<p>And of the old Roman tales he’d teach –</p>
<p>How Simplicius Gallus left his wife,</p>
<p>And forsook her for the rest of his life,</p>
<p>Because he saw her hatless in the way,</p>
<p>As he looked out his door one fine day.</p>
<p>Another Roman, he told me his names,</p>
<p>Because his wife went to the summer Games</p>
<p>Without him knowing, he forsook her too.</p>
<p>And then would he to his Bible go anew</p>
<p>And seek that proverb of the Ecclesiast,</p>
<p>Where he commands and forbids, aghast:</p>
<p>“Man shall not suffer his wife to gad about.”</p>
<p>Then would he speak like this, without doubt:</p>
<p>“Whoever builds his house of willows,</p>
<p>And spurs his blind horse o’er the fallows,</p>
<p>And sees his wife a pilgrim to All Hallows,</p>
<p>Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows!”</p>
<p>But all for naught – I cared never a haw</p>
<p>For his proverbs, and his old saw,</p>
<p>Nor would I by him corrected be.</p>
<p>I hate him who my vice tells to me;</p>
<p>And so do more, God knows, of us than I!</p>
<p>He was enraged with me, fit to die;</p>
<p>I could not stand him in any case, alas.</p>
<p>Now will I tell you true, by Saint Thomas,</p>
<p>Why I tore that page out of his book,</p>
<p>From which my ear was deafened by his stroke.</p>
<p>He had a book that gladly night and day,</p>
<p>For his pleasure he would read always.</p>
<p>He called it Theophrastus and Valerius –</p>
<p>At which he used to laugh fit to bust.</p>
<p>And then there was some clerk at Rome,</p>
<p>A Cardinal, named Saint Jerome,</p>
<p>Who made a book against Jovinian;</p>
<p>In which book bound up was Tertullian,</p>
<p>With Chrysippus, Trotula, Heloise,</p>
<p>That was abbess not far from Paris,</p>
<p>And the parables of Solomon,</p>
<p>Ovid’s Art of Love, and many a one.</p>
<p>And all of these bound in the one volume,</p>
<p>And every night and day it was his custom,</p>
<p>When he had leisure and vacation</p>
<p>From other worldly occupation,</p>
<p>To read in this book of wicked wives.</p>
<p>He knew of them more legends and lives</p>
<p>Than there are of good wives in the Bible.</p>
<p>For trust me well, it is impossible</p>
<p>For any clerk to speak well of wives</p>
<p>Unless it is of holy saints’ lives,</p>
<p>Never of any other woman though.</p>
<p>Who wrote the histories, tell me who?</p>
<p>By God, if women had written the stories</p>
<p>As clerics have within their oratories,</p>
<p>They’d have written of men more wickedness</p>
<p>Than all the sons of Adam could redress!</p>
<p>The children of Venus and Mercury</p>
<p>In all their workings are contrary:</p>
<p>Mercury loves wisdom and science,</p>
<p>And Venus loves spending, revelry, and dance.</p>
<p>And because of their diverse disposition,</p>
<p>Each is in fall in the other’s exaltation;</p>
<p>So, God knows, Mercury is helpless,</p>
<p>In Pisces where exalted is Venus,</p>
<p>And Venus falls when Mercury is raised.</p>
<p>Therefore no woman is by cleric praised.</p>
<p>The clerk, when he is old, and cannot do</p>
<p>Of Venus’ works the worth of his old shoe,</p>
<p>Then sits he down and writes in his dotage</p>
<p>That women cannot be true in marriage!</p>
<p>But now to my purpose, as I told you,</p>
<p>How I was beaten for a book, all true.</p>
<p>One night Jankin, that was our sire,</p>
<p>Read his book, as he sat by the fire,</p>
<p>Of Eve first, that through her wickedness</p>
<p>Brought all mankind to wretchedness,</p>
<p>For which indeed was Jesus Christ slain,</p>
<p>Who purchased us with his heart’s-blood again.</p>
<p>Lo here, expressed of women may you find,</p>
<p>That woman was the bane of all mankind!</p>
<p>Then he read to me how Samson lost his hair:</p>
<p>Sleeping, his lover cut it with her shears,</p>
<p>Through which treason he lost both his eyes.</p>
<p>Then he read me, for I’ll tell no lies,</p>
<p>Of Hercules, Deianira, and the pyre</p>
<p>Where, through her, he set himself on fire.</p>
<p>Nor did he miss the sorrow and woe too</p>
<p>That Socrates had with his wives two –</p>
<p>How Xantippe poured piss over his head.</p>
<p>The foolish man sat still, as he were dead.</p>
<p>He wiped his head; no more dare say again,</p>
<p>But: “Ere the thunder stops, comes the rain.”</p>
<p>– Of Pasiphae, that was the Queen of Crete;</p>
<p>Out of maliciousness he thought that sweet –</p>
<p>Fie, speak no more, it is a grisly thing,</p>
<p>Of her fierce lust, and perverse liking!</p>
<p>– Of Clytemnestra, for her lechery</p>
<p>That made her husband die by treachery;</p>
<p>He read all that with great devotion.</p>
<p>He told me also on what occasion</p>
<p>Amphiaraus at Thebes lost his life;</p>
<p>My husband had the legend of his wife,</p>
<p>Eriphyle, who for a necklace of gold</p>
<p>Secretly to all the Greeks had told</p>
<p>Of her husband’s private hiding-place,</p>
<p>For which at Thebes he did misfortune taste.</p>
<p>Of Livia he told me, and Lucilia:</p>
<p>They both killed their husbands there,</p>
<p>The one for love, the other out of hate.</p>
<p>Livia her husband one evening late</p>
<p>Empoisoned, because she was his foe.</p>
<p>Lucilia, lascivious, loved hers so</p>
<p>That, to make him always of her think,</p>
<p>She gave him such a manner of love-drink</p>
<p>That he was dead ere it was the morrow –</p>
<p>And thus in every way husbands have sorrow.</p>
<p>Then he told me how one Latumius</p>
<p>Complained to his comrade Arrius,</p>
<p>That in his garden there grew a tree</p>
<p>On which he said that his wives three</p>
<p>Hanged themselves, for spite it was.</p>
<p>“Oh dear brother,” quoth this Arrius,</p>
<p>“Give me a cutting from that blessed tree,</p>
<p>And in my garden planted it shall be!”</p>
<p>Of wives of later date he also read,</p>
<p>How some had slain their husbands in their bed,</p>
<p>And let their lovers pleasure them all night,</p>
<p>While the corpse lay on the floor upright;</p>
<p>And some had driven nails through their brain,</p>
<p>While they were sleeping, and thus them slain.</p>
<p>Some had given them poison in their drink.</p>
<p>He spoke more harm than heart could think,</p>
<p>And with all that he knew more proverbs</p>
<p>Than in this world grow grass or herbs.</p>
<p>“Better,” quoth he, “that your habitation</p>
<p>Be with a lion or a foul dragon,</p>
<p>Than with a woman who will always chide.</p>
<p>Better,” quoth he, “high on the roof to abide,</p>
<p>Than with an angry wife down in the house;</p>
<p>They are so wicked and cantankerous</p>
<p>They hate what their husbands love,” he’d say,</p>
<p>“A woman always casts her shame away</p>
<p>When she casts off her smock,” and lo,</p>
<p>“A fair woman unless she’s chaste also,</p>
<p>Is like a gold ring in a sow’s nose.”</p>
<p>Who would think, or who could suppose</p>
<p>The woe, that in my heart was, and pain?</p>
<p>And when I say he did begin again</p>
<p>Reading of that cursed book all night,</p>
<p>All suddenly three leaves then did I</p>
<p>Pluck from his book, as he read and, weak</p>
<p>As I am, my fist so took him on the cheek</p>
<p>That in our fireplace he fell backward down.</p>
<p>And started up as does a raging lion,</p>
<p>And with his fist he struck me on the head,</p>
<p>That on the floor I lay as I were dead.</p>
<p>And when he saw how still that I lay,</p>
<p>He was aghast, and would have fled away,</p>
<p>Till at last I came to and raised my head.</p>
<p>“Oh, have you slain me, false thief,” I said,</p>
<p>“And for my land thus have you murdered me?</p>
<p>Ere I be dead, yet will I kiss thee!”</p>
<p>And near he came and knelt right down,</p>
<p>And said: “Dear sister, my Alison,</p>
<p>So help me God, I shall thee never smite.</p>
<p>That I have done so was your fault outright;</p>
<p>Forgive me yet, and that I do beseech.”</p>
<p>And once again I hit him on the cheek,</p>
<p>And said: “Thief, my vengeance thus I wreak!</p>
<p>Now will I die; I may no longer speak.”</p>
<p>But in the end, with care and much ado,</p>
<p>We came to an agreement did we two.</p>
<p>He gave the bridle all into my hand,</p>
<p>To me the governance of house and land,</p>
<p>And of his tongue and of his hand also,</p>
<p>And I made him burn his book of woe.</p>
<p>And when that I had gotten unto me</p>
<p>By mastery all the sovereignty,</p>
<p>And that he said: “Mine own true wife,</p>
<p>Do as you wish through all your term of life;</p>
<p>Guard your honour, and my good estate,”</p>
<p>After that day we had no more debate.</p>
<p>God help me so, I was as kind to him</p>
<p>As any wife from Denmark unto Inde,</p>
<p>And also true, and so was he to me.</p>
<p>I pray to God that sits in majesty,</p>
<p>To bless his soul, of His mercy dear!</p>
<p>Now will I say my tale, if you will hear.’</p> 

<p>The Friar laughed when he had heard all this;</p>
<p>‘Now dame,’ quoth he, ‘so send me joy and bliss,</p>
<p>This is a long preamble to a tale!’</p>
<p>And when the Summoner heard the Friar rail,</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ quoth the Summoner, ‘God’s arms two,</p>
<p>A Friar will interfere whatever you do!</p>
<p>Lo, good men, a fly and then a friar</p>
<p>Will fall in every dish and every fire!</p>
<p>What do you mean by your ‘preambulation’?</p>
<p>Come, amble, or trot, or sit, or stay in motion!</p>
<p>You’re hindering our sport in this manner.’</p>
<p>‘You think so, Sir Summoner,’ quoth the Friar.</p>
<p>‘Now, by my faith, I shall, before I go</p>
<p>Tell of a summoner a tale or so,</p>
<p>That all the folk shall laugh in this place.’</p>
<p>‘Now if not, Friar, I will curse your face,’</p>
<p>Quoth the Summoner, ‘and then curse me,</p>
<p>If I do not tell a tale or two or three,</p>
<p>Of Friars, ere I come to Sittingborne,</p>
<p>That will make your very heart go mourn,</p>
<p>For well I know your patience is all gone.’</p>
<p>Our Host cried: ‘Peace, and that anon!’</p>
<p>And said: ‘Let the woman tell her tale.</p>
<p>You bicker like folk full drunk on ale.</p>
<p>Come, dame, tell forth your tale, that will be best.’</p>
<p>‘All ready, sir,’ quoth she, ‘just as you wish,</p>
<p>If I have licence of this worthy Friar.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, dame,’ quoth he, ‘tell forth and I will hear.’</p>

<p>In the olden days of King Arthur,</p>
<p>Of whom Britons speak with great honour,</p>
<p>All this land was filled full with faerie.</p>
<p>The Elf-Queen with her fair company</p>
<p>Danced full oft in many a green mead.</p>
<p>That was the old opinion, as I read –</p>
<p>I speak of many hundred years ago.</p>
<p>But now no man sees elves I know,</p>
<p>For now the endless charity and prayers</p>
<p>Of limiters and other holy friars,</p>
<p>Who search every field and every stream</p>
<p>As thick as are the motes in a sun-beam,</p>
<p>Blessing halls, chambers, kitchens, bowers,</p>
<p>Cities, boroughs, castles and high towers,</p>
<p>Thorps, barns, cattle-sheds, and dairies –</p>
<p>This is why there are no longer faeries.</p>
<p>For wherever there used to walk an elf,</p>
<p>There walks now the limiter himself</p>
<p>In the noon-time and in the mornings,</p>
<p>And says his matins and his holy things</p>
<p>As he goes round his limitation’s bounds.</p>
<p>Women may go safely up and down;</p>
<p>In every bush or under every tree,</p>
<p>There is no incubus about but he,</p>
<p>And he will only do them dishonour.</p>
<p>And it so befell that this King Arthur</p>
<p>Had in his house a lusty bachelor</p>
<p>Who one day came riding from the river,</p>
<p>And it chanced that, alone as he was born,</p>
<p>He saw a maiden walking there at dawn,</p>
<p>Of which maid, no matter how she pled,</p>
<p>By very force he stole her maidenhead;</p>
<p>Which oppression raised so great a clamour</p>
<p>And such petitions to King Arthur</p>
<p>That this knight was condemned as dead</p>
<p>Bu court of law and set to lose his head –</p>
<p>Peradventure, such was the statute though –</p>
<p>But that the Queen and other ladies so</p>
<p>Prayed the King for so long for his grace</p>
<p>That he his life granted him in its place,</p>
<p>And gave him to the Queen, to do her will,</p>
<p>To choose whether she would save or kill.</p>
<p>The Queen thanked the King with all her might;</p>
<p>And after thus she spoke to the knight,</p>
<p>When she thought it right, upon a day,</p>
<p>‘You yet stand,’ quoth she, ‘in such array</p>
<p>That of your life you yet shall have no surety.</p>
<p>I grant you life though, if you can tell me</p>
<p>What thing it is that women most desire.</p>
<p>Beware and keep your neck from axe’s ire!</p>
<p>And if you cannot tell me now anon,</p>
<p>Yet I will give you leave to be gone</p>
<p>A twelve-month and a day, and everywhere</p>
<p>Seek answer sufficient to this matter there.</p>
<p>And surety will I have, before you ride a pace,</p>
<p>That you return in person to this place.’</p>
<p>Woe was this knight, and sorrowfully mired,</p>
<p>But then, he might not do as he desired.</p>
<p>And at the last he chose to go and wend,</p>
<p>And come again, right at the year’s end,</p>
<p>With such answer as God would him purvey;</p>
<p>And so took leave and wended on his way.</p>
<p>He sought at every house in every place</p>
<p>Wherever he had hopes of finding grace,</p>
<p>To learn what thing women love the most;</p>
<p>But could not find by inland field or coast</p>
<p>Any one solution to this matter</p>
<p>On which two creatures agreed together.</p>
<p>Some said women had most love of riches;</p>
<p>Some said honour, some said happiness;</p>
<p>Some rich array, some said lust abed,</p>
<p>And oft times to be widowed and to wed.</p>
<p>Some said that our heart is most eased</p>
<p>When we are flattered most and pleased.</p>
<p>(I cannot lie! He’s very near reality;</p>
<p>A man may win us best by flattery;</p>
<p>And with attention, all the business,</p>
<p>Are we best snared, the great and less.)</p>
<p>And some said that we love best</p>
<p>To be free, and do as we’re possessed,</p>
<p>And that no man reprove us of our vice,</p>
<p>But claim we are not fools but somewhat wise.</p>
<p>For truly there is none at all among us,</p>
<p>If anyone on some sore spot will rub us</p>
<p>That will not kick if he tells the truth.</p>
<p>Try, and you will find it so, in sooth.</p>
<p>For, be we ever so vicious within,</p>
<p>We would be held as wise and free of sin.</p>
<p>And some said that great delight have we</p>
<p>In being thought dependable, discreet,</p>
<p>Steadfastly maintaining our purpose well,</p>
<p>And not betraying things that some might tell –</p>
<p>But value that at less than a rake-handle!</p>
<p>Woman’s discretion isn’t worth a candle;</p>
<p>Witness old Midas – will you hear the tale?</p>
<p>Ovid, amongst his great and small ale,</p>
<p>Says Midas had, under his long hair,</p>
<p>Upon his head two ass’s ears there;</p>
<p>The which deformity he hid from sight</p>
<p>Of every man, as subtly as he might,</p>
<p>That save his wife, none knew it was so.</p>
<p>He loved her best, and trusted her also;</p>
<p>He begged her that to no creature</p>
<p>She would tell of this sad feature.</p>
<p>She swore ‘no’, for all the world to win,</p>
<p>She would not do such villainy and sin,</p>
<p>As to gain her husband so foul a name;</p>
<p>She would not tell she said out of shame.</p>
<p>But nevertheless she almost died</p>
<p>At having this secret so long to hide.</p>
<p>She felt it swell so sore about her heart</p>
<p>That some word was sure from her to start.</p>
<p>And since she dared tell it to no man,</p>
<p>Down the marsh close nearby she ran –</p>
<p>Till she reached it her heart was all afire –</p>
<p>And as a bittern booms in the mire,</p>
<p>She laid her mouth to the water down.</p>
<p>‘Betray me not, water, with your sound!’</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘I tell it now, but just to you:</p>
<p>My husband has long ass’s ears two!</p>
<p>Now is my heart all whole; now is it out.</p>
<p>I could no longer hide it, have no doubt.’</p>
<p>Here you see, that we can for a time abide,</p>
<p>Yet out it must; we can no secret hide.</p>
<p>The remainder of the tale, if you would hear,</p>
<p>Read Ovid, and you will find it there.</p>
<p>The knight of whom my tale tells specially,</p>
<p>When he saw he could not find out easily –</p>
<p>That is to say, what women love the most –</p>
<p>Within his breast full sorrowful was his ghost.</p>
<p>But home he goes; he could not make sojourn;</p>
<p>The day was come when homeward he must turn.</p>
<p>And on his way back he happened to ride,</p>
<p>Full of his cares, under a forest side,</p>
<p>Where he saw dancing on woodland floor</p>
<p>Of ladies four and twenty, and yet more.</p>
<p>Towards the which dance he began to turn,</p>
<p>In hope that some wisdom he might learn.</p>
<p>But certainly, before he was fully there,</p>
<p>Vanished was the dance; he knew not where.</p>
<p>No creature saw he that showed sign of life,</p>
<p>Save, sitting on the green, an old wife –</p>
<p>A fouler one than her might none devise.</p>
<p>Against the knight this wife began to rise</p>
<p>And said: ‘Sir knight, here there lies no way.</p>
<p>Tell me what you are seeking, by your faith!</p>
<p>Peradventure it might be better thus for thee;</p>
<p>This old woman knows many things,’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘My dear mother,’ quoth the knight, ‘for certain</p>
<p>I am a dead man, unless I can show plain</p>
<p>What thing it is that women most desire.</p>
<p>Should you enlighten me, I’d pay your hire.’</p>
<p>‘Plight me your troth, here by my hand,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘That the next thing I require of thee</p>
<p>You shall do, if it lies within your might,</p>
<p>And I will tell you of it ere it be night.’</p>
<p>‘Here, by my truth!’ quoth the knight, ‘Agreed.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ quoth she, ‘I dare boast readily</p>
<p>Your life is safe, for I will stand thereby.</p>
<p>Upon my life, the Queen will speak as I.</p>
<p>Let’s see if then the proudest of them all</p>
<p>That wears a head-cloth or a gemmed caul</p>
<p>Dare say nay to that which I shall teach.</p>
<p>Let us go on without longer speech.’</p>
<p>Then she whispered something in his ear,</p>
<p>And bade him to be glad and have no fear.</p>
<p>When they had reached the court, this knight</p>
<p>Declared he had kept his promise, to the night,</p>
<p>And ready was his answer, as he said.</p>
<p>Full many a noble wife and many a maid</p>
<p>And many a widow – since they are wise –</p>
<p>And the Queen herself, sitting in justice high,</p>
<p>Were assembled his answer there to hear;</p>
<p>And in a while the knight was bade appear.</p>
<p>Of everyone demanded was their silence,</p>
<p>And that the knight should tell his audience</p>
<p>What thing that worldly women love the best.</p>
<p>The knight forbore to stand there like a beast,</p>
<p>But to her question swiftly answered her</p>
<p>In manly voice, so all the court could hear.</p>
<p>‘My liege lady, generally,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>Women desire the self-same sovereignty</p>
<p>Over a husband as they do a lover,</p>
<p>And to hold mastery, he not above her.</p>
<p>That is your great desire, though you me kill;</p>
<p>Do as you wish; I am at your will.’</p>
<p>In all the court there was nor wife nor maid</p>
<p>Nor widow who could challenge what he said,</p>
<p>But said that he was worthy to have his life.</p>
<p>And at that word up started the old wife</p>
<p>Whom the knight had found sitting on the green.</p>
<p>‘Mercy, ‘quoth she, ‘my sovereign lady queen;</p>
<p>Ere that your court depart, see me aright.</p>
<p>I taught this answer to this same knight,</p>
<p>For which he plighted me his troth entire,</p>
<p>That the first thing I should of him require</p>
<p>He would do, if it lay within his might.</p>
<p>Before the court then, pray I you, sir knight,’</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘that you take me as your wife,</p>
<p>For you know well that I have saved your life.</p>
<p>If I say false, say so, upon your faith.’</p>
<p>The knight answered, ‘Alas and well-away!</p>
<p>I know right well that such was my behest.</p>
<p>For God’s love, now choose a fresh request!</p>
<p>Take all my goods, and let my body go.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, then,’ quoth she, ‘A curse upon us two!</p>
<p>For though that I be foul and old and poor,</p>
<p>I wish not, for all the metal and the ore</p>
<p>That is buried under earth or lies above,</p>
<p>For aught but to be your wife, and your love.’</p>
<p>‘My love!’ quoth he, ‘nay, my damnation!</p>
<p>Alas, that any of my nation</p>
<p>Should ever be disgraced so foully!’</p>
<p>But all for naught; the end is this, that he</p>
<p>Had little choice; he needs must her wed,</p>
<p>And take his old wife, and go to bed.</p>
<p>Now some men would say, peradventure,</p>
<p>That in my negligence I make no feature</p>
<p>Of all the joy there was and the array</p>
<p>That at the feast appeared that very day.</p>
<p>To which thing briefly I answer shall:</p>
<p>I say, there was no joy or feast at all;</p>
<p>There was only heaviness and much sorrow.</p>
<p>For secretly he wedded her that morrow,</p>
<p>And all day after hid him like an owl;</p>
<p>Such woe was on him – with a wife so foul.</p>
<p>Great was the woe the knight had in his thought</p>
<p>When he was with his wife to bed there brought;</p>
<p>He thrashed about and twisted to and fro.</p>
<p>His old wife lay smiling broadly though,</p>
<p>And said: ‘O dear husband, benedicitee!</p>
<p>Does every knight do with his wife as thee?</p>
<p>Is this the law about King Arthur’s house?</p>
<p>Is every knight of his so mean a louse?</p>
<p>I am your own love, and then your wife;</p>
<p>I am she who has saved your life,</p>
<p>And, for sure, I have served you right.</p>
<p>Why do you thus with me this first night?</p>
<p>You act as would a man who’d lost his wit!</p>
<p>What is my sin? For God’s love, tell me it,</p>
<p>And it shall be amended, if I may.’</p>
<p>‘Amended,’ quoth the knight, ‘Alas, nay, nay!</p>
<p>It cannot be amended evermore.</p>
<p>You are so ugly, and so old, and more</p>
<p>You come also of such a lowly kin,</p>
<p>That little wonder is I thrash and spin.</p>
<p>God, would the heart but burst in my breast!’</p>
<p>‘Is this,’ quoth she, ‘the cause of your unrest?’</p>
<p>Yes,’ quoth he, what wonder all’s amiss?’</p>
<p>‘Now, sire,’ quoth she, ‘I could amend all this,</p>
<p>If I wished, before we have seen days three,</p>
<p>If you would but bear yourself well towards me.</p>
<p>If you all think by speaking of nobleness</p>
<p>Such as has descended from old riches,</p>
<p>That therefore it makes you noble men,</p>
<p>Such arrogance is not worth a hen.</p>
<p>Look for the most virtuous man always,</p>
<p>In private and public, who sees his way</p>
<p>To doing the noblest deeds that he can,</p>
<p>There will you find the greatest gentleman.</p>
<p>Christ wills we take from him our gentleness,</p>
<p>Not from our ancestors, despite their riches.</p>
<p>For though they leave us all their heritage,</p>
<p>From which we claim noble parentage,</p>
<p>Yet can they still bequeath us nothing</p>
<p>Not one of us, of their virtuous living,</p>
<p>That made them gentlemen in name to be,</p>
<p>Who bade us follow them in that degree.</p>
<p>Well has the wise poet of Florence,</p>
<p>Dante, I mean, spoken in this same sense –</p>
<p>Lo, in such verse Dante’s tale advances:</p>
<p>“Seldom arises by his slender branches</p>
<p>Man’s prowess, for God, of his goodness,</p>
<p>Wills that of him we claim our gentleness.”</p>
<p>For from our elders we can nothing claim</p>
<p>But temporal things, which may hurt and maim.</p>
<p>And everyone knows this as well as me:</p>
<p>If nobility were implanted naturally</p>
<p>In a certain lineage down the line,</p>
<p>Publicly, privately then the vine</p>
<p>Of noble work would be evergreen;</p>
<p>They would enact no vice or villainy.</p>
<p>Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house</p>
<p>Between here and the distant Caucasus,</p>
<p>And let men shut the doors and return,</p>
<p>Yet will the fire remain there and burn</p>
<p>As if twenty thousand did it behold.</p>
<p>Its natural office it will ever hold,</p>
<p>On peril of my life, until it die.</p>
<p>Thus you may see how the noble eye</p>
<p>Is not wedded to possession,</p>
<p>Since folk do not maintain its function</p>
<p>Forever, as does fire, lo, of its kind.</p>
<p>For, God knows, men will often find</p>
<p>A lord’s son acting shameful villainy.</p>
<p>And he who wants to claim nobility</p>
<p>Because he was born of a noble house,</p>
<p>His ancestors noble and virtuous,</p>
<p>And yet himself has done no noble deeds,</p>
<p>Nor followed his noble ancestors deceased,</p>
<p>He is not noble, be he duke or earl,</p>
<p>For base sinful deeds make the churl.</p>
<p>While mere renown makes gentility,</p>
<p>Your ancestors and their great bounty,</p>
<p>Which is external and not your own;</p>
<p>Your nobility comes from God alone.</p>
<p>Thus comes our own nobility by grace;</p>
<p>Not bequeathed to us by rank and place.</p>
<p>Think how noble, as says Valerius,</p>
<p>Was that Tullius Hostilius,</p>
<p>Who rose from poverty to high status,</p>
<p>Read Seneca and read Boethius,</p>
<p>There is it both expressed and agreed</p>
<p>That he is noble who does noble deeds.</p>
<p>And therefore, dear husband, I conclude</p>
<p>Although my ancestry is rough and rude,</p>
<p>Yet may God on high, I hope, may He</p>
<p>Grant me the grace to live virtuously.</p>
<p>Thus am I noble, when I first begin</p>
<p>To live in virtue, and abandon sin.</p>
<p>And in that you my poverty reprove,</p>
<p>The God whom we believe in and love,</p>
<p>In wilful poverty chose to live his life.</p>
<p>And surely, every man, maid or wife</p>
<p>Understands that Jesus, Heaven’s King,</p>
<p>Could yield of his life no vicious thing.</p>
<p>Honest poverty is fine, that’s certain:</p>
<p>This, Seneca and other clerks maintain.</p>
<p>The man content with poverty, I assert</p>
<p>That man is rich, although he lacks a shirt.</p>
<p>He that covets wealth is all the poorer</p>
<p>For he would have what is not in his power.</p>
<p>But he who has naught, yet does not crave,</p>
<p>Is rich, although you hold him but a knave.</p>
<p>True poverty sings, in reality.</p>
<p>Juvenal says of poverty appositely:</p>
<p>“The poor man, as he goes on his way</p>
<p>Beside the thief, may ever sing and play.”</p>
<p>Poverty though hateful’s good nonetheless</p>
<p>In that it is a great release from business;</p>
<p>A great augmenter too of sapience,</p>
<p>To the man accepting it with patience.</p>
<p>Poverty, though it seems second best,</p>
<p>Is a possession no man can contest.</p>
<p>Poverty, often, when a man is humble</p>
<p>Leads him to God, and to himself as well.</p>
<p>Poverty is a glass, it seems to me,</p>
<p>Through which he may his true friends see.</p>
<p>And thus, sire, since I wish no grief to you,</p>
<p>Of my poverty show no more reproof.</p>
<p>Now, sire, of being old you reprove me;</p>
<p>And certainly, though no authority</p>
<p>Were found in books, yet men of honour</p>
<p>Say that you should show an old man favour,</p>
<p>And call him father, out of courteousness;</p>
<p>And authors too say so, as I would guess.</p>
<p>Now then you say that I am foul and old,</p>
<p>Well then you need not fear to be cuckold.</p>
<p>For poverty and old age, you must agree,</p>
<p>Are great guardians of chastity.</p>
<p>Yet nonetheless, since I know your delight,</p>
<p>I shall fulfil your worldly appetite.</p>
<p>Choose now,’ quoth she, ‘which of these to try:</p>
<p>To see me old and ugly till I die,</p>
<p>And be to you a true and humble wife,</p>
<p>Who never will displease you all my life,</p>
<p>Or else you may have me young and fair,</p>
<p>And take the risk that all those who repair</p>
<p>To our house are there because of me,</p>
<p>And to other places, it well may be.</p>
<p>Now choose, yourself, just as you like.’</p>
<p>The knight thought deeply and with a sigh</p>
<p>At last he replied to her in this manner:</p>
<p>‘My lady and my love, and wife so dear,</p>
<p>I place myself in your wise governance.</p>
<p>Choose yourself which is the most pleasant,</p>
<p>And brings most honour to me and you.</p>
<p>I do not care which it is of the two,</p>
<p>For as you like it, that suffices me.’</p>
<p>‘Then have I won the mastery,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘Since I may choose and govern as I wish?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, surely, wife,’ quoth he, ‘I hold that best.’</p>
<p>‘Kiss me,’ quoth she, ‘and no more wrath.</p>
<p>For, by my troth, I to you will be both –</p>
<p>That is to say, both fair and good.</p>
<p>I pray to God I shall die mad, and would,</p>
<p>If I be not to you both good and true</p>
<p>As ever wife was, since the world was new.</p>
<p>And if I be not tomorrow as fair to see</p>
<p>As any lady, Empress or Queen may be,</p>
<p>Who lives between the east and the west,</p>
<p>Do what you wish touching my life and death.</p>
<p>Lift the curtain; see what already is.’</p>
<p>And when the knight swiftly saw all this,</p>
<p>That she was young, and lovely too,</p>
<p>For joy he took her in his arms two.</p>
<p>His heart was bathed in a bath of bliss;</p>
<p>A thousand times in a row they kiss,</p>
<p>And she obeyed him in everything</p>
<p>That pleased him and was to his liking.</p>
<p>And thus they lived to their lives end</p>
<p>In perfect joy – and Jesus Christ us send</p>
<p>Husbands meek, young, and fresh abed,</p>
<p>And grace to outlive those that we wed.</p>
<p>And also I pray Jesus, trim the lives</p>
<p>Of those who won’t be governed by their wives,</p>
<p>Those old and angry, grudging all expense,</p>
<p>God send them soon indeed the pestilence!</p>

<p>The worthy Limiter, our noble Friar,</p>
<p>Kept glancing round with a scowl of ire</p>
<p>Towards the Summoner, but from honesty</p>
<p>No villainous word as yet spoke he.</p>
<p>But at last he turned to the Wife:</p>
<p>‘Dame,’ quoth he, ‘God grant you a good life!</p>
<p>You have here touched, I must agree,</p>
<p>On high matters of great difficulty.</p>
<p>You have said many things well, I say.</p>
<p>But, dame, here as we ride by the way,</p>
<p>We are but asked to speak and play a game,</p>
<p>And leave true authority, in God’s name,</p>
<p>To the preachers and the schools of clergy.</p>
<p>But if it’s pleasing to this company,</p>
<p>I’ll tell you of a summoner, the same.</p>
<p>Pardee, you may know just by the name</p>
<p>Of summoner there’s no good to be said –</p>
<p>I pray that none of you will be offended.</p>
<p>A summoner runs up and down the nation</p>
<p>With summonses concerning fornication,</p>
<p>Him people thrash at every town’s end.’</p>
<p>Our Host then spoke: ‘Ah, sire, please extend</p>
<p>Courtesy, as of a man in your estate!</p>
<p>In company we’ll have no such debate.</p>
<p>Tell your tale, and let the Summoner be!’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the Summoner, ‘let him call me</p>
<p>Whatever he wishes; when I tune my note</p>
<p>By God, I’ll repay him every groat!</p>
<p>I’ll tell him, then, how great an honour</p>
<p>It is to be a flattering limiter,</p>
<p>And of the many other kinds of crime</p>
<p>That need no rehearsing at this time,</p>
<p>And explain his office to him, as it is!’</p>
<p>Our Host answered: ‘Peace, no more of this!’</p>
<p>And after that he turned to the Friar:</p>
<p>‘Tell forth your tale, now, my good sire.’</p>

<p>Once there was, dwelling in my country,</p>
<p>An archdeacon, a man of high degree,</p>
<p>Who boldly served the law’s execution</p>
<p>In the punishment of fornication,</p>
<p>Of witchcraft, and also of bawdry,</p>
<p>Of defamation, and adultery,</p>
<p>Of church robbery, and of testaments</p>
<p>Of contracts, and neglect of sacraments,</p>
<p>Of usury, and of simony also.</p>
<p>But on the lechers he served greatest woe;</p>
<p>He made them sing, if less than innocent,</p>
<p>And small tithe-payers if they missed the rent,</p>
<p>If any parson should of them complain.</p>
<p>They could not avoid pecuniary pain;</p>
<p>For short tithes and short offerings</p>
<p>He made the people piteously sing.</p>
<p>For ere the bishop caught them with his crook,</p>
<p>They were down in the archdeacon’s book,</p>
<p>And then had he, through his jurisdiction,</p>
<p>Power to administer correction.</p>
<p>He had a summoner ready to his hand;</p>
<p>A slyer lad was none in all England.</p>
<p>For subtly he set spies on the trail</p>
<p>Who showed him his profit without fail.</p>
<p>He would spare the lechers, three or four,</p>
<p>To lead the way to four and twenty more.</p>
<p>For though our man go mad as a hare,</p>
<p>To tell his wickedness I will not spare;</p>
<p>For we are free from his correction.</p>
<p>Over us they have no jurisdiction,</p>
<p>Nor ever shall, throughout their lives.</p>
<p>‘St Peter! Thus the women in the dives,’</p>
<p>Quoth the Summoner, ‘are past our cure!’</p>
<p>‘Peace to mischance and misadventure!’</p>
<p>– So said our Host – ‘and let him tell his tale.</p>
<p>Now tell it forth, though the Summoner pale;</p>
<p>And spare him not, my own good sire.’</p>
<p> This false thief, this summoner – quoth the Friar –</p>
<p>Had pimps always ready to his hand,</p>
<p>As any hawk to lure in all England,</p>
<p>Who told him all the secrets that they knew,</p>
<p>For their acquaintance was nothing new;</p>
<p>They were his private agents, his spies.</p>
<p>He made himself great profits thereby;</p>
<p>His master knew not always what he won.</p>
<p>And without a warrant he would summon</p>
<p>Some lewd man, on pain of Christ’s curse,</p>
<p>And all would be content to fill his purse,</p>
<p>And buy him great feasts at the inn.</p>
<p>And just as Judas had his purse, his sin</p>
<p>Being theft, just such a thief was he.</p>
<p>His master received but half the duty.</p>
<p>He was, if I should praise him and applaud,</p>
<p>A thief, and then a summoner, and a bawd.</p>
<p>And he had wenches in his retinue</p>
<p>That, whether Sir Robert or Sir Hugh,</p>
<p>Or Jack or Ralph, whoever might appear</p>
<p>And lie with them, they told it in his ear.</p>
<p>So were the wench and he of one intent.</p>
<p>And he would fetch a forged writ hence,</p>
<p>And summon both to Chapter Court and so</p>
<p>He’d fleece the man and let the wench go.</p>
<p>Then would he say: ‘Friend, for you, alack,</p>
<p>I’ll strike her name out of our letters black.</p>
<p>You need no more in her cause travail;</p>
<p>I am your friend, in this I may avail.’</p>
<p>Certain he knew of swindles old and new,</p>
<p>More than could be told in a year or two.</p>
<p>For in this world no dog that tracks the bow</p>
<p>Could tell a hurt deer from a whole one so</p>
<p>Well as this summoner could a sly lecher,</p>
<p>Or an adulterer, or yet a lover.</p>
<p>And as that was the bulk of all his rent,</p>
<p>Therefore on that he set his whole intent.</p>
<p>And so befell it once that on a day,</p>
<p>This summoner, ever waiting on his prey,</p>
<p>Rode to summon an old widow of the tribe,</p>
<p>Feigning a cause, expecting a bribe;</p>
<p>And chanced to see before him on the ride</p>
<p>A merry yeoman under a forest side.</p>
<p>A bow he bore, and arrows bright and keen;</p>
<p>He wore a woollen jacket all in green,</p>
<p>A hat upon his head with fringes black.</p>
<p>‘Sire,’ quoth this Summoner, reigning back,</p>
<p>Hail and well met! And every good man more!’</p>
<p>‘Whither ride you under this greenwood shaw?’</p>
<p>Said the yeoman: ‘Go you far today?’</p>
<p>The summoner answered him and said: ‘Nay;</p>
<p>Here close by,’ quoth he, ‘it’s my intent</p>
<p>To ride, and then to summon up a rent</p>
<p>That is owing there to my lord, you see,’</p>
<p>‘You are a bailiff then?’ ‘Yes’ quoth he.</p>
<p>He dare not, for very stain and shame,</p>
<p>Say that he was a summoner, by name.</p>
<p>‘Depardieux,’ quoth the yeoman, ‘dear brother,</p>
<p>You are a bailiff, and I am another.</p>
<p>I am a stranger now to this country;</p>
<p>For your acquaintance I would beg thee,</p>
<p>And brotherhood as well, if you wish.</p>
<p>I have gold and silver in my chest;</p>
<p>If you chance to cross into our shire,</p>
<p>All shall be yours, as much as you desire.’</p>
<p>‘Graunt mercy,’ quoth the summoner, ‘by my faith!’</p>
<p>Each on the other’s hand his truth pledged</p>
<p>To be brothers sworn till their dying day,</p>
<p>And rode chatting pleasantly on their way.</p>
<p>The summoner, who was as full of words</p>
<p>As full of venom are the butcher-birds,</p>
<p>And ever enquiring about everything,</p>
<p>‘Brother,’ quoth he, ‘where is your dwelling,</p>
<p>If I were to seek you out another day?</p>
<p>The yeoman answered in his soft-spoken way:</p>
<p>‘Brother,’ quoth he, ‘far in the north country,</p>
<p>Where I hope some time you’ll visit me.</p>
<p>Ere we part, I’ll tell you where it is,</p>
<p>So my house there you shall never miss.’</p>
<p>‘Now brother,’ quoth the summoner, ‘I pray,</p>
<p>Tell me, while we are riding on our way –</p>
<p>Since you are a bailiff the same as me –</p>
<p>Some subtle trick, and tell me faithfully</p>
<p>In my office how I may most win;</p>
<p>And spare not for conscience or for sin,</p>
<p>But as my brother tell me how do ye.’</p>
<p>‘Now my by troth, dear brother,’ said he,</p>
<p>‘I will tell you then a faithful tale:</p>
<p>My wages are scanty, right small ale,</p>
<p>My lord is hard to me, ungenerous,</p>
<p>And my office is thus laborious,</p>
<p>And therefore by extortion do I live;</p>
<p>Forsooth, I take whatever men will give.</p>
<p>Any way, by tricks or violence,</p>
<p>From year to year I cover my expense.</p>
<p>I can no better tell it, truthfully.’</p>
<p>‘Well, now,’ quoth the summoner, ‘same as me!’</p>
<p>I never hesitate to take, God knows,</p>
<p>Long as it’s not too hot or heavy though.</p>
<p>What I may get in private, secretly,</p>
<p>Is not a question of conscience, to me.</p>
<p>Were it not for extortion, I’d no living.</p>
<p>Nor of such tricks shall I be shriven;</p>
<p>Feeling or conscience know I none.</p>
<p>I curse those confessors ever a one!</p>
<p>Well are we met, by God and by Saint James!</p>
<p>But, dear brother, tell me then your name.’</p>
<p>Quoth the summoner. Now, all the while</p>
<p>The yeoman had displayed a little smile.</p>
<p>‘Brother,’ quoth he, ‘would you have me tell?</p>
<p>I am a fiend; my dwelling is in Hell.</p>
<p>And here I ride about my purchasing</p>
<p>To see if men will give me anything.</p>
<p>My profit is the total, just like rent.</p>
<p>Look how you ride upon the same intent,</p>
<p>To win your profit – you don’t care how –</p>
<p>Well so fare I, for ride I would right now</p>
<p>Unto the world’s end following my prey.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ quoth the summoner, ‘benedicite!</p>
<p>What’s this? I thought you were a yeoman, truly;</p>
<p>You have a man’s shape as well as me.</p>
<p>Have you another shape determinate</p>
<p>In Hell, where you are in your own true state?</p>
<p>‘Nay, for sure,’ quoth he, ‘there have we none.</p>
<p>But when we choose, then we can don one,</p>
<p>Or else make you believe we have a shape.</p>
<p>Sometimes we’re like a man, or like an ape,</p>
<p>Or like an angel can I ride and go.</p>
<p>It is no wondrous thing though it be so;</p>
<p>A louse-ridden juggler can deceive thee,</p>
<p>And, pardee, I’ve much more power than he.’</p>
<p>‘Why,’ quoth the summoner, ‘do you ride and run</p>
<p>In sundry shape, and not always in one?’</p>
<p>‘That we,’ quoth he, ‘may such forms awake</p>
<p>As are most useful when our prey we take.’</p>
<p>‘What makes you undertake all this labour?’</p>
<p>‘Many a reason, dear sir summoner,’</p>
<p>Said the fiend, ‘but all things in good time.</p>
<p>The day is short, and it is long past prime,</p>
<p>And yet I’ve gathered nothing all this day.</p>
<p>I must attend to profit if I may,</p>
<p>And our stratagems I’ll not declare;</p>
<p>For, brother mine, your wit is all too bare</p>
<p>To understand, though I should tell them thee.</p>
<p>But as you asked why so labour we:</p>
<p>Sometimes we are God’s own instruments,</p>
<p>The means to execute his commandments,</p>
<p>When he wishes to, upon his creatures,</p>
<p>In various ways and under various features.</p>
<p>Without him we have no power, again,</p>
<p>If he should wish to stand against our aim.</p>
<p>And sometimes at our request we have leave</p>
<p>Only the body, but not the soul, to grieve;</p>
<p>Witness Job, whom we brought such woe.</p>
<p>But sometimes we have power over both:</p>
<p>That is to say of body and soul also.</p>
<p>And sometimes we are allowed to go</p>
<p>Attack a man, and bring his soul unrest,</p>
<p>And not his body, then all is for the best</p>
<p>If he withstands our sore temptation;</p>
<p>Since it is a cause of his salvation,</p>
<p>Albeit that such was never our intent</p>
<p>To save, but rather to have him pent.</p>
<p>And sometimes we are servants to some man,</p>
<p>As to the archbishop Saint Dunstan;</p>
<p>To the Apostles a servant once was I.’</p>
<p>‘Then tell me,’ quoth the summoner, ‘speak no lie,</p>
<p>Make you your new bodies thus always</p>
<p>From the elements?’ The fiend answered: ‘Nay.</p>
<p>Sometimes we’re illusions, sometimes rise</p>
<p>With corpses’ bodies in sundry wise,</p>
<p>And speak as fluently and fair and well</p>
<p>As, to the Witch of Endor, Samuel.</p>
<p>(And yet some men say it was not he –</p>
<p>I grant no worth to your theology.)</p>
<p>But one thing I warn you of, it’s no jape:</p>
<p>You’ll know one day how we find a shape;</p>
<p>You shall hereafter, my brother dear,</p>
<p>Come where you need not lend an ear!</p>
<p>For you will, from your own experience,</p>
<p>Be able to lecture in word and sentence</p>
<p>Better than Virgil when he was alive,</p>
<p>Or Dante. Now let us swiftly ride,</p>
<p>For I will keep company with thee,</p>
<p>Till you may choose to forsake me.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the summoner, ‘let us ride!</p>
<p>I’m a yeoman known both far and wide;</p>
<p>My pledge will I keep, as I have done.</p>
<p>For though you were the devil himself, Satan,</p>
<p>My pledge will I keep to you, my brother,</p>
<p>As I swore, and each swore to the other,</p>
<p>To be a true brother in every case.</p>
<p>And both can go about our purchase;</p>
<p>Take you your share of what men will give,</p>
<p>And I will mine; thus we both may live.</p>
<p>And if either has more than the other,</p>
<p>Let him be true, and share with his brother.’</p>
<p>‘Agreed,’ quoth the devil, ‘by my faith!’</p>
<p>And with that they rode forth on their way,</p>
<p>And right at the start of the town end</p>
<p>To which this summoner planned to wend,</p>
<p>They saw a cart loaded up with hay,</p>
<p>That a carter drove forth on his way.</p>
<p>Deep was the mud, and the cart was stuck;</p>
<p>The carter shouted out like mad, and struck:</p>
<p>‘Hey Brock! Hup, Scot! Mind you the stones?</p>
<p>The fiend,’ quoth he, ‘take you, skin and bones,</p>
<p>As surely as ever that you were foaled,</p>
<p>So much is the woe you bring, all told!</p>
<p>The devil take all, horse, cart and hay!’</p>
<p>The summoner said: ‘Here’s good play!’</p>
<p>And as if naught were doing, he drew near,</p>
<p>And quietly whispered in his friend’s ear:</p>
<p>‘Hearken, my brother, hearken, by my faith!</p>
<p>Do you not hear what the carter says?</p>
<p>Take them anon, for he has given them thee,</p>
<p>Hay and cart, and also his horses three.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the devil, ‘God knows, never a bit!</p>
<p>Trust me well, he’s never a wish for it.</p>
<p>Ask him yourself, if you trust not me,</p>
<p>Or else wait a while and you will see.’</p>
<p>The carter struck his horses on the rump,</p>
<p>And they began to haul, as he thumped.</p>
<p>‘Gee up,’ quoth he, ‘and Jesus Christ bless,</p>
<p>You and all his handiwork, both great and less!</p>
<p>That was well pulled, my own Grey Boy!</p>
<p>I pray God save you, and His Saint Loy.</p>
<p>Now is my cart out of the slough, pardee!’</p>
<p>‘Lo, brother,’ quoth the fiend, ‘what told I thee?</p>
<p>Here you may see, my own dear brother,</p>
<p>The man spoke one thing, but meant another.</p>
<p>Les us sally forth on our voyage;</p>
<p>Here I win nothing, goods or carriage.’</p>
<p>When they were some way out of town,</p>
<p>The summoner softly began to sound:</p>
<p>‘Brother,’ quoth he, ‘here lives an old wreck,</p>
<p> Who would almost as soon lose her neck</p>
<p>As give you a pennyworth of what she has.</p>
<p>I’ll have twelve pence of her, though she wax mad,</p>
<p>Or I’ll have to summon her to our office –</p>
<p>And yet, God knows, of her I know no vice.</p>
<p>But since you have failed in this country</p>
<p>To gain a profit, well then, learn from me.’</p>
<p>The summoner knocked at the widow’s gate.</p>
<p>‘Come out,’ quoth he, ‘you old reprobate!</p>
<p>I swear you’ve some friar or priest with thee.’</p>
<p>‘Who’s knocking?’ cried the wife, ‘benedicitee!</p>
<p>God save you, sire; what is your good will?’</p>
<p>‘I have,’ quoth he, ‘with me a summons-bill.</p>
<p>On pain of excommunication, you shall be</p>
<p>To-morrow at the arch-deacon’s knee</p>
<p>To answer in his court to certain things.’</p>
<p>‘Now, Lord,’ quoth she, ‘Christ Jesus, King of Kings,</p>
<p>Help me, for sure, as only You may!</p>
<p>I have been sick, and that for many a day;</p>
<p>I cannot go so far,’ quoth she,’ nor ride,</p>
<p>Except I die, it pricks so in my side.</p>
<p>May I not have a writ, sir summoner,</p>
<p>And answer there yet through my lawyer</p>
<p>To such charges as men press against me?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ quoth the summoner, ‘pay – let’s see –</p>
<p>Twelve pence to me, and I may you acquit.</p>
<p>I shall not profit by it, not a bit.</p>
<p>My master takes the profit, none to me.</p>
<p>Quick now, I must ride on and hurriedly;</p>
<p>Give me twelve pence, for I cannot tarry.’</p>
<p>‘Twelve pence!’ quoth she, ‘Now Lady Saint Mary</p>
<p>Defend me surely from care and sin,</p>
<p>Though this whole wide world I might win,</p>
<p>I have not twelve pence for hand to hold.</p>
<p>You well know that I am poor and old;</p>
<p>Show charity to me, a poor wretch.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, then,’ quoth he, ‘the devil may me fetch,</p>
<p>If I’ll excuse you, though you go to ruin!’</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ quoth she, ‘God knows, I have no coin!’</p>
<p>‘Pay me,’ quoth he, ‘by the sweet Saint Anne,</p>
<p>Or I will carry off your brand new pan</p>
<p>Against the debt you owe to me of old,</p>
<p>When you made your husband cuckold;</p>
<p>I paid back home for your correction.’</p>
<p>‘You lie!’ quoth she, ‘By my salvation,</p>
<p>I was never ere now, widow or wife,</p>
<p>Summoned to your court in all my life,</p>
<p>Nor never was I with my body untrue.</p>
<p>To the devil rough and black of hue</p>
<p>Give I your body, and my pan also!’</p>
<p>And when the devil heard her cursing so</p>
<p>Upon her knees, he spoke in this manner:</p>
<p>‘Now, Mabel, my own mother dear,</p>
<p>Is this your wish in earnest that you say?’</p>
<p>‘The devil, quoth she, ‘come fetch him today,</p>
<p>And pan and all, unless he shall repent!’</p>
<p>‘Nay, old bawd, that is not my intent,’</p>
<p>Quoth the summoner, ‘to repent, not me,</p>
<p>For anything that I have had of thee.</p>
<p>I would I had your smock, rag and cloth!’</p>
<p>‘Now, brother,’ quoth the devil, ‘be not wrath:</p>
<p>Your body and this pan are mine by right.</p>
<p>You yet shall go to Hell with me tonight,</p>
<p>Where you shall know of our mysteries</p>
<p>More than does any master of divinity.’</p>
<p>And with that the foul fiend dragged him hence;</p>
<p>Body and soul he with the devil went</p>
<p>Where summoners receive their heritage.</p>
<p>And God who made, after His own image,</p>
<p>Mankind, save and guide us, all and some,</p>
<p>And let these summoners good men become!</p>
<p>Lordings, I could have told you – said the Friar –</p>
<p>Had I the time, and this Summoner desire,</p>
<p>Drawing on texts of Christ, Paul and John,</p>
<p>And of other teachers, many a one,</p>
<p>Of torments that will freeze hearts, in some wise;</p>
<p>Although the tongue can scarcely devise,</p>
<p>Though for a thousand winters I might tell</p>
<p>Of it, the pain of this cursed house of Hell.</p>
<p>But to defend us from that cursed place,</p>
<p>Watch and pray to Jesus for his grace;</p>
<p>So guard us from the tempter Satan base.</p>
<p>Hark to my word – beware, as in this case:</p>
<p>‘The lion sits in wait for us always</p>
<p>To slay the innocent, if ever he may.</p>
<p>Dispose your hearts always to withstand</p>
<p>The fiend, who would grip you in his hand.’</p>
<p>He may not tempt you beyond your might,</p>
<p>For Christ will be your champion and knight.</p>
<p>And pray that all these summoners repent</p>
<p>Of their misdeeds, before they’re summoned hence!</p>

<p>The Summoner, up in his stirrups high, stood;</p>
<p>His heart against this Friar filled with blood</p>
<p>And like an aspen leaf he shook, with ire.</p>
<p>‘Lordings,’ quoth he, ‘but one thing I desire:</p>
<p>I beseech you that of your courtesy, I,</p>
<p>Since you have heard this false Friar lie,</p>
<p>May be suffered now my tale to tell!</p>
<p>This Friar boasts that he knows of Hell,</p>
<p>And God knows, that is little wonder;</p>
<p>Friars and fiends are seldom far asunder.</p>
<p>For, pardee, you often times heard tell</p>
<p>How that a friar was dragged off to Hell</p>
<p>In the spirit once, and in a vision,</p>
<p>And as an angel led him up and down</p>
<p>To show him all the torments of the fire,</p>
<p>In all the place he never saw a Friar;</p>
<p>Of other folk he saw enough, in woe.</p>
<p>Unto the angel spoke the Friar, though:</p>
<p>“Now sire, ‘quoth he, ‘are Friars in such grace,</p>
<p>That none of them shall ever reach this place?”</p>
<p>“Nay,” quoth the angel, “millions are found</p>
<p>Below! And unto Satan he led him down.</p>
<p>“Now Satan you see” says he, “has a tail</p>
<p>Wider than of a carrack is the sail.</p>
<p>Hols up your tail, now Satan!” quoth he,</p>
<p>“Show us your arse, and let the Friar see</p>
<p>Where is the nest for Friars in this place.”</p>
<p>And in less than half a minute’s space,</p>
<p>Just as bees swarm from out a hive,</p>
<p>Out of the devil’s arse began to drive</p>
<p>Twenty thousand Friars in a rout,</p>
<p>And off through Hell they swarmed about,</p>
<p>And returned again as fast as they had gone</p>
<p>And into his arse they crept everyone;</p>
<p>He clapped his tail again and lay still.</p>
<p>The Friar, when he had looked his fill</p>
<p>On all the torments in this sorry place,</p>
<p>His spirit God restored, of his grace,</p>
<p>To his body again, and he awoke.</p>
<p>But nevertheless for fear he still shook,</p>
<p>The devil’s arse was there yet in his mind;</p>
<p>Such is the heritage of all his kind.</p>
<p>God save you all, save this cursed Friar!</p>
<p>My prologue ends, all that I shall require.’</p>


<p>Lordings there lies, in Yorkshire as I guess,</p>
<p>A marshy country known as Holderness,</p>
<p>In which a friar, a limiter, went about</p>
<p>To preach, and to beg as well, no doubt.</p>
<p>And it befell that on a day this friar</p>
<p>He preached at a church as he desired,</p>
<p>And specially, above every other thing,</p>
<p>Excited all the people by his preaching</p>
<p>To buy masses, and give for God’s sake</p>
<p>Coins with which men might holy houses make,</p>
<p>Those where divine service is honoured –</p>
<p>Not where it is wasted and devoured,</p>
<p>Nor where there’s no need for men to give,</p>
<p>As to endowed clergymen, who live,</p>
<p>Thanks be to God, in wealth and abundance!</p>
<p>‘Masses,’ said he, ‘deliver from all penance</p>
<p>Your friends’ souls, whether old or young,</p>
<p>Yes, even when they are quickly sung –</p>
<p>Not to say that a priest has gone astray;</p>
<p>Because he only sings one mass a day.</p>
<p>‘Deliver then, anon’ quoth he, ‘the souls!</p>
<p>Full hard it is with flesh-hooks and with awls</p>
<p>To be clawed, or yet to burn or bake.</p>
<p>Do it swiftly now, for Christ’s sake!’</p>
<p>And when the Friar had shown his intent,</p>
<p>With qui cum patre on his way he went.</p>
<p> When folk in church had given him what he wished,</p>
<p>He went his way – no longer would he rest –</p>
<p>With scrip and pointed staff, his gown tucked high.</p>
<p>Into every house he’d begin to peer and pry,</p>
<p>And begged for meal and cheese, or else corn.</p>
<p>His comrade had a staff, tipped with horn,</p>
<p>A pair of writing-tables, in ivory,</p>
<p>And a stylus, polished all elegantly,</p>
<p>And wrote the names down, as he stood,</p>
<p>Of all the folk that gave him any food,</p>
<p>As if for them he’d pray, by and by.</p>
<p>‘Give us a bushel, wheat, malt, or rye,</p>
<p>A God’s cake, or a little piece of cheese,</p>
<p>Anything you wish; all things do please.</p>
<p>A God’s halfpenny, or a mass-penny,</p>
<p>Or give us of your brawn, if you have any;</p>
<p>A portion of your blanket, dear dame,</p>
<p>Our sister true – lo, here I write your name –</p>
<p>Bacon or beef, or anything you find.’</p>
<p>A sturdy varlet followed them behind,</p>
<p>Who was their inn-servant, and bore a sack,</p>
<p>And what men gave them, carried on his back;</p>
<p>And when he was out of doors, and alone,</p>
<p>He’d scrape away the names, every one</p>
<p>That he had written on his writing-tables;</p>
<p>He served them all with faery-tales and fables.</p>
<p>‘Nay, there you lie, you Summoner!’ quoth the Friar.</p>
<p>‘Peace!’ quoth our Host, ‘for Christ’s mother dear!</p>
<p>Tell us your tale, and spare us not at all.’</p>
<p>‘So thrive I,’ quoth the Summoner, ‘that I shall.</p>
<p>So along he goes from house to house, till he</p>
<p>Comes to a house where he is wont to be</p>
<p>Refreshed better than a hundred other places.</p>
<p>The good man lies sick whose house it is.</p>
<p>Bedridden there on a low couch lay he.</p>
<p>‘Deus hic!’ quoth he, ‘O Thomas, friend, good day!’</p>
<p>Said this friar courteously and full soft.</p>
<p>‘Thomas,’ quoth he, ‘God guard you, full oft</p>
<p>Have I upon this bench eaten full well!</p>
<p>Here have I eaten many a merry meal.’</p>
<p>And from the bench he drove away the cat,</p>
<p>And laid down his pointed staff and hat,</p>
<p>And his scrip too, and sat him quietly down.</p>
<p>His comrade had walked off into town,</p>
<p>Together with his knave, to the hostelry</p>
<p>Where he had thought that night to sleep.</p>
<p>‘O my dear master, ‘quoth the sick man,</p>
<p>‘How are things with you? Since March began</p>
<p>I’ve not seen you for a fortnight or more.’</p>
<p>‘God knows,’ quoth he, ‘I’ve laboured full sore,</p>
<p>And especially for your salvation</p>
<p>Have I said many a precious orison,</p>
<p>And for our other friends, God them bless!</p>
<p>I have today been at your church at Mass,</p>
<p>And given a sermon, used my simple wit –</p>
<p>Not using all the text of holy writ,</p>
<p>Since it’s too hard for you, as I suppose,</p>
<p>And therefore I paraphrase, for those</p>
<p>Who find it so, it’s fine to paraphrase,</p>
<p>For “the letter killeth”, as the Bible says.</p>
<p>In it I told them to be charitable,</p>
<p>And spend their coin, in manner reasonable;</p>
<p>And there I saw your dame – ah, where is she?’</p>
<p>‘Yonder in the yard I think she’ll be.’</p>
<p>Said the man, ‘and she’ll be here anon.’</p>
<p>‘Ey, master, welcome be ye, by Saint John!’</p>
<p>Said the wife: ‘How fair you, heartily?’</p>
<p>The friar rose full of courtesy,</p>
<p>And embraced her in his arms narrow,</p>
<p>And kissed her sweet and chirped like a sparrow</p>
<p>With his lips. ‘Dame,’ quoth he, ‘right well,</p>
<p>As he that is your servant and ever shall</p>
<p>Thank God that gave you soul and life!</p>
<p>Yet saw I not today as fair a wife</p>
<p>In all the church about, God save me!’</p>
<p>‘Yet God amend my faults, sire,’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘You are welcome at any rate, by my faith!’</p>
<p>‘Graunt mercy, dame, this have I found always.</p>
<p>But in your great goodness, by your leave,</p>
<p>I pray take no offence, and do not grieve,</p>
<p>If I must speak with Thomas a while though.</p>
<p>These curates are full negligent and slow</p>
<p>At groping tenderly after the conscience.</p>
<p>In shriving, preaching, is my diligence,</p>
<p>And studying of Peter’s words and Paul’s.</p>
<p>I walk and fish for Christian men’s souls,</p>
<p>To yield to Jesus Christ his proper rent;</p>
<p>To spread his word is all my true intent.’</p>
<p>‘Now, by your leave, O dear sire,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘Scold him well, by the sacred Trinity!</p>
<p>He’s irritable as an ant beside the fire,</p>
<p>Though he has all that he could desire.</p>
<p>Though I cover him at night and keep him warm,</p>
<p>And over him lay my leg or my arm,</p>
<p>He groans like the boar that’s in our sty.</p>
<p>Other sport of him right none have I;</p>
<p>I may not please him any way, alas.’</p>
<p>‘O Thomas, je vous dy, Thomas, Thomas!</p>
<p>This is the fiend’s work, and must be mended!</p>
<p>Anger’s a thing that cannot be defended,</p>
<p>And therefore will I say a word or so.’</p>
<p>‘Now, master,’ quoth the wife, ‘ere I go,</p>
<p>What will you dine on? And then I’ll do it.’</p>
<p>‘Now dame,’ quoth he, ‘now je vous dy sanz doute,</p>
<p>Had I of a capon but the liver,</p>
<p>And of your soft bread just a sliver,</p>
<p>And after that a roasted pig’s head –</p>
<p>Though just for me I’d wish no creature dead –</p>
<p>Then that would be homely munificence.</p>
<p>I am a man needs little sustenance;</p>
<p>My spirit gets its nourishment from the Bible.</p>
<p>The body is so zealous, always so liable</p>
<p>To pray and wake, my appetite is destroyed.</p>
<p>I pray you dame, be not too annoyed,</p>
<p>If I speak frankly and confide in you.</p>
<p>By God, I tell such only to a few!’</p>
<p>‘Now, sire,’ quoth she, ‘one word before I go:</p>
<p>My child died scarcely two weeks ago,</p>
<p>Shortly after you had left the town.’</p>
<p>‘His death I saw in a revelation,’</p>
<p>Said the friar, ‘at home it was in our</p>
<p>Dormitory, I’d say, not half an hour</p>
<p>After his death, I saw him born to bliss</p>
<p>In a vision, God send me not amiss!</p>
<p>So did our sexton and our infirmary friars,</p>
<p>That have been true men these fifty years;</p>
<p>They may now, God be thanked for His loan,</p>
<p>Make their jubilee, and be free to walk alone.</p>
<p>And up I rose and all our convent meek,</p>
<p>With many a tear trickling down my cheek,</p>
<p>Without a noise or clattering of bells.</p>
<p>Te deum was our song, and nothing else,</p>
<p>Save that to Christ I said an orison,</p>
<p>Thanking Him for His revelation.</p>
<p>For, sire and dame, trust to me right well,</p>
<p>Our orisons are more effectual,</p>
<p>We see more into Christ’s secret things</p>
<p>Than laymen do, even though they be kings.</p>
<p>We live in poverty and abstinence,</p>
<p>While laymen live in luxury, expense</p>
<p>On meat and drink, and in their foul delight.</p>
<p>We set this world’s lust beyond our sight.</p>
<p>Lazarus and Dives lived diversely,</p>
<p>And they were rewarded differently.</p>
<p>Whoso will pray must fast and be clean,</p>
<p>And feed his soul, but keep his body lean.</p>
<p>We fare as the Gospel says: clothes and food</p>
<p>Suffice for us, though they be coarse and rude.</p>
<p>The cleanliness and fasting of us friars</p>
<p>Is what makes Jesus Christ accept our prayers.</p>
<p>Lo, Moses forty days and forty nights</p>
<p>Fasted, before the great God in his might</p>
<p>Spoke with him on the summit of Sinai;</p>
<p>With empty stomach, fasting fit to die,</p>
<p>He received the law that was written</p>
<p>By God’s finger; and Elijah, when</p>
<p>On Mount Horeb, before he had speech</p>
<p>With God Almighty, who acts as our leech</p>
<p>Healing us, fasted long, in contemplation.</p>
<p>Aaron too, that had the regulation</p>
<p>Of the Temple, and Levites every one,</p>
<p>Into the Temple when they were gone</p>
<p>To pray for the people, and serve there,</p>
<p>They would take no drink, that is, no manner</p>
<p>Of drink which might them drunken make,</p>
<p>But there in abstinence would pray and wake,</p>
<p>Lest they die. Take heed then of what I say:</p>
<p>Unless they are sober who for people pray,</p>
<p>Beware what I say; enough, that suffices!</p>
<p>‘Our Lord Jesus, as holy writ advises,</p>
<p>Is our example, in fasting and in prayers.</p>
<p>Therefore we mendicants, we simple friars,</p>
<p>Have wedded poverty and continence,</p>
<p>Charity, humility, and abstinence,</p>
<p>Persecution for our righteousness,</p>
<p>Weeping, charity, and cleanliness.</p>
<p>And therefore you can see that our prayers –</p>
<p>I speak of us, we mendicants, we friars –</p>
<p>Are to the high God more acceptable</p>
<p>Than yours, with your feasting at table.</p>
<p>For his gluttony, and I tell no lies,</p>
<p>Man was first driven from Paradise,</p>
<p>And man was chaste in Paradise, for sure.</p>
<p>‘But hearken now, Thomas, I say more:</p>
<p>– I have no text of what I wish to say</p>
<p>But I shall seek it in a paraphrase –</p>
<p>For especially our sweet lord Jesus</p>
<p>Spoke of the friars, when he said thus:</p>
<p>“Blessed be those who poor in spirit be.”</p>
<p>And so in all the Gospel you may see,</p>
<p>Whether it is more like to our profession,</p>
<p>Or theirs who swim in riches and possessions.</p>
<p>Fie on their pomp, and their gluttony! Fie,</p>
<p>And as for sinfulness, I them defy.</p>
<p>I liken them to that Jovinian,</p>
<p>Fat as a whale, and waddling like a swan,</p>
<p>As full of wine as a bottle, what’s the sense</p>
<p>In their saying prayers full of reverence,</p>
<p>And chanting for souls the Psalm of David:</p>
<p>“Lo, burp!” they sing, “cor meum eructavit!”</p>
<p>Who follows Christ’ gospel and his spoor,</p>
<p>But we the humble, the chaste and poor,</p>
<p>Workers of God’s word, not its auditors?</p>
<p>Therefore, right as a hawk that upward soars</p>
<p>Springs up into the air, right so the prayers</p>
<p>Of charitable, chaste and busy friars</p>
<p>Soar upwards towards God’s ears two.</p>
<p>Thomas, Thomas, as I live, say I too,</p>
<p>By that lord who is named Saint Ives,</p>
<p>Who’s not our brother, as you are, never thrives.</p>
<p>In our Chapter pray we day and night,</p>
<p>To Christ, that he send you health and might</p>
<p>To give you use of your body speedily.’</p>
<p>‘God knows, quoth he, ‘none of it I feel!</p>
<p>So help me Christ, in but a few years</p>
<p>I have spent on every manner of friars</p>
<p>Full many a pound, yet never the better.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s almost left me now a debtor;</p>
<p>Farewell my gold, it is gone long ago!’</p>
<p>The Friar answered: ‘O Thomas, say you so?</p>
<p>What needed you those various friars seek?</p>
<p>What need has he who has a perfect leech</p>
<p>To go seeking other leeches round the town?</p>
<p>Your inconstancy shall bring you down!</p>
<p>Do you maintain that my, or else our convent’s,</p>
<p>Prayers for you have been insufficient?</p>
<p>Thomas, that raillery’s not worth a fiddle!</p>
<p>Your malady’s because we prayed too little.</p>
<p>Ah, give that convent half a quarter of oats!</p>
<p>Ah, give that convent four and twenty groats!</p>
<p>Ah, give that friar a penny and let him go!</p>
<p>Nay, nay, Thomas, it should not be so!</p>
<p>What is a farthing worth that’s cut in twelve?</p>
<p>Lo, each thing that’s united in itself</p>
<p>Is stronger than when it’s widely scattered.</p>
<p>Thomas, by me you shall not be flattered:</p>
<p>You would have all our labour for naught.</p>
<p>The great God, who all this world has wrought,</p>
<p>Says that the workman’s worthy of his hire.</p>
<p>Thomas, naught of your treasure I desire,</p>
<p>For myself, but only that our convent</p>
<p>Should pray for you and be diligent,</p>
<p>And for to build Christ’s own church.</p>
<p>Thomas if you would learn to do good works,</p>
<p>You may find if building, for your sin,</p>
<p>Is good, in the life of Thomas Saint of Inde.</p>
<p>You lie here full of anger and of ire</p>
<p>With which the devil sets your heart afire,</p>
<p>And chide here this foolish innocent</p>
<p>Your wife, who is so meek and so patient.</p>
<p>And therefore Thomas – believe me as you wish –</p>
<p>Strive not with your wife: that’s for the best.</p>
<p>And bear this word away now, by your faith,</p>
<p>Touching all this – hear, what the wise say:</p>
<p>“Within your house act not like a lion;</p>
<p>Against your household raise no oppression,</p>
<p>Nor serve to make your acquaintance flee.”</p>
<p>And Thomas, a second time I charge thee:</p>
<p>Beware of her that in your bosom sleeps!</p>
<p>Beware the serpent that so slyly creeps</p>
<p>Below the grass, and stings with subtlety.</p>
<p>Beware, my son, and listen patiently,</p>
<p>For twenty thousand men have lost their lives</p>
<p>In striving with their lovers and their wives.</p>
<p>Now since you have so holy and meek a wife,</p>
<p>What need have you, Thomas, to make strife?</p>
<p>Truly there is no serpent half so cruel</p>
<p>When man treads on his tail, or half so fell,</p>
<p>As woman is when she is full of fire,</p>
<p>Vengeance then is all that they desire.</p>
<p>Anger is sin, one of the deadly seven,</p>
<p>Abominable to the great God of Heaven,</p>
<p>And to the man himself it is destruction.</p>
<p>This every illiterate vicar or parson</p>
<p>Can tell you, ire engenders homicide.</p>
<p>Ire is, in truth, the executor of pride.</p>
<p>I could of ire tell you so much sorrow</p>
<p>My tale should last until tomorrow;</p>
<p>And therefore I pray God, both day and night,</p>
<p>God send the angry man no power or might!</p>
<p>It does great harm, and brings great misery,</p>
<p>To yield a wrathful man the mastery.</p>
<p>‘One there was a wrathful potentate,</p>
<p>Seneca says, and while he ruled the state,</p>
<p>One fine day out rode there knights two.</p>
<p>And as Fortune willed, as she will do,</p>
<p>One of them came home, the other not.</p>
<p>Anon the knight before the judge was brought,</p>
<p>Who said thus: “You have your fellow slain,</p>
<p>For which I sentence you to death, again.”</p>
<p>And to another knight commanded he:</p>
<p>“Go, lead him to his death, I order thee.”</p>
<p>And so it came to pass as they went by</p>
<p>Towards the place where he should die,</p>
<p>The knight appeared whom men thought dead.</p>
<p>Then it seemed best that both be led</p>
<p>Straight back, returned to the judge again.</p>
<p>They said: “Lord, the knight has not slain</p>
<p>His fellow; here he stands, whole alive.”</p>
<p>“You shall die,” quoth he, “as I thrive!</p>
<p>That is to say, one and two and three.”</p>
<p>And to the first knight thus right spoke he:</p>
<p>“I condemned you; and you shall be dead.</p>
<p>And you, his fellow, also lose your head,</p>
<p>For you are the reason why this man must die.”</p>
<p>And on the third knight he cast his eye:</p>
<p>“You have not done as I commanded thee” –</p>
<p>And thus he had the knights slain, all three.</p>
<p>Wrathful Cambyses was a drunkard too,</p>
<p>And loved to be a villain through and through.</p>
<p>And it so befell a lord of his company,</p>
<p>Who valued virtuous morality,</p>
<p>Said one day in private speech right thus:</p>
<p>“A lord is lost if he is vicious,</p>
<p>And drunkenness is foul to record</p>
<p>Of any man, especially a lord.</p>
<p>There is full many an eye and many an ear</p>
<p>Near to a lord, of which he’s not aware.</p>
<p>For God’s love, drink more temperately!</p>
<p>Wine makes man lose most wretchedly</p>
<p>His mind, and his limbs’ use, every one.”</p>
<p>“The reverse,’ quoth the King, “you’ll see anon,</p>
<p>And prove it by your own experience,</p>
<p>That wine does to folk no such offence.</p>
<p>There is no wine shall rob me of my might</p>
<p>In hand or foot, nor of my own eyesight.”</p>
<p>And at that he drank as much and more</p>
<p>A hundredfold as he had done before.</p>
<p>And right anon this wrathful cursed wretch</p>
<p>Had this knight’s son before him fetched,</p>
<p>Commanding that before him he should stand,</p>
<p>And suddenly he took his bow in hand,</p>
<p>And pulled the string taut towards his ear,</p>
<p>And with an arrow slew the child right there.</p>
<p>“Now do I have a steady hand, or none?”</p>
<p>Quoth he. “Is all my mind and power gone?</p>
<p>Has wine deprived me of my eyesight?”</p>
<p>What answer was there for the sorry knight?</p>
<p>His son was slain; there is no more to say.</p>
<p>Beware, therefore, with lords how you play.</p>
<p>Sing: “Placebo”, and “I shall if I can”,</p>
<p>Unless it be to some poor old man.</p>
<p>To a poor man men should his vices tell,</p>
<p>But not to a lord, though on his way to Hell.</p>
<p>Behold, wrathful Cyrus, the Persian,</p>
<p>Who brought the river Gindes to ruin,</p>
<p>Because a horse of his was drowned therein,</p>
<p>When that he went for Babylon to win.</p>
<p>He ensured the river was left so narrow,</p>
<p>That women might wade across its shallows.</p>
<p>Lo, what Solomon taught, as none can:</p>
<p>“Be not the fellow to a wrathful man,</p>
<p>Nor with an angry man walk by the way</p>
<p>Lest you repent of it; that is all I say.”</p>
<p>Now, Thomas, dear brother, cease your anger.</p>
<p>You’ll find me true as is a joiner’s square.</p>
<p>Hold not the devil’s knife towards your heart –</p>
<p>Your anger causes you a bitter smart –</p>
<p>But make to me your whole confession.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the sick man, ‘by Saint Simon,</p>
<p>I’ve been shriven today by my curate.</p>
<p>I have told him of my whole estate;</p>
<p>There’s no more need to speak of it, said he,</p>
<p>Unless I wish, out of humility.’</p>
<p>‘Give me of your gold then for our cloister,’</p>
<p>Quoth he, ‘for many a mussel and many an oyster,</p>
<p>When others have eaten well, many a day,</p>
<p>Have been our food, our cloister for to raise.</p>
<p>And yet, God knows, the bare foundation</p>
<p>Nor yet our pavement, is scarcely done</p>
<p>There’s not a tile yet been laid,’ he groans,</p>
<p>‘By God, we still owe forty pounds for stones!</p>
<p>Now help, Thomas, for Him that harrowed Hell,</p>
<p>Or else must we our books go and sell.</p>
<p>And if you lacked our true instruction,</p>
<p>Then goes the world to its destruction.</p>
<p>For who would this world of us bereave,</p>
<p>So God me save, Thomas, by your leave,</p>
<p>He would bereave this world of the sun.</p>
<p>For who can teach and work as we can?</p>
<p>And have, for no little time,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘For since Elijah, and Elisha, we,</p>
<p>The friars, have, as the books record,</p>
<p>Done charity, and thanks be to our Lord!</p>
<p>Now, Thomas, help, for holy charity!’</p>
<p>And down anon he went on bended knee.</p>
<p>The sick man was well nigh mad with ire;</p>
<p>He wished the friar might be set afire,</p>
<p>With his falsehood and dissimulation.</p>
<p>‘Such as I have in my possession’</p>
<p>Quoth he, ‘that may I give, I have no other.</p>
<p>Did you say to me I am your brother?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, certainly,’ the friar said, ‘trust me;</p>
<p>I gave your dame a letter with our seal.’</p>
<p>‘Well now,’ quoth he, ‘something I shall give</p>
<p>Unto your holy convent while I live.</p>
<p>And in your hand have it you shall anon –</p>
<p>On this and on no other condition:</p>
<p>That you share it out, my dear brother,</p>
<p>So each friar has as much as every other.</p>
<p>This shall you swear, on your profession,</p>
<p>Without fraud or equivocation.’</p>
<p>‘I swear it,’ quoth the friar, ‘on my faith!’</p>
<p>And with that his hand in his he laid.</p>
<p>‘Lo here’s my faith, in me you’ll find no lack.’</p>
<p>‘Now then, put your hand down behind my back,’</p>
<p>Said the man, ‘and grope around behind,</p>
<p>Beneath my buttocks; there you will find</p>
<p>A thing that I have hidden secretly.’</p>
<p> ‘Ah!’ thought the friar, ‘that will do for me!’</p>
<p>And down his hand he sank to the cleft,</p>
<p>In hopes of finding there a little gift.</p>
<p>And when the sick man felt the friar</p>
<p>Groping round his arse, here and there,</p>
<p>Into the friar’s hand he let fall a fart.</p>
<p>There was no dray-horse pulling on a cart</p>
<p>That could have farted with a louder sound.</p>
<p>The friar started up like an angry lion.</p>
<p>‘Ah, false churl!’ quoth he, ‘by God’s bones,</p>
<p>This was done for spite!’ The friar moans:</p>
<p>‘You’ll pay dearly for that fart, some day!’</p>
<p>The servants, who heard the whole affray,</p>
<p>Came leaping in and chased him from the place,</p>
<p>And off he went with a full angry face,</p>
<p>And fetched his comrade and all his store</p>
<p>Of goods, and fierce as champs a wild boar,</p>
<p>He ground his teeth, so great was his wrath.</p>
<p>At a swift pace to the manor he strode off,</p>
<p>Where there lived a man of great honour,</p>
<p>To whom he had ever been his confessor;</p>
<p>This worthy man was lord of the village.</p>
<p>The friar came there in a blinding rage</p>
<p>Where the lord sat eating at his board.</p>
<p>The friar could hardly utter a word,</p>
<p>Till at last he said, ‘God be with thee!’</p>
<p>The lord looked up, and said, ‘Benedicitee!</p>
<p>What, Friar John, what in the world is this?</p>
<p>I can see that something’s well amiss.</p>
<p>You look as if the wood was full of thieves!</p>
<p>Sit down anon, and tell me now what grieves,</p>
<p>And it shall be amended, if I may.’</p>
<p>‘I have,’ quoth he, ‘received insult today,</p>
<p>God keep you, down there in your village,</p>
<p>Such that there’s never so lowly a page</p>
<p>But that he would find it an abomination</p>
<p>That which I have received in your town.</p>
<p>And yet nothing grieves me so sore</p>
<p>As that this old churl with locks hoar,</p>
<p>Has blasphemed our holy convent too.’</p>
<p>‘Now master,’ quoth the lord, ‘I beseech you –’</p>
<p>‘Not master,’ quoth he, ‘but your servitor!</p>
<p>Though the schools have done me that honour,</p>
<p>God wishes not that “Rabbi” men should call,</p>
<p>Us, in the market-place, or your great hall.’</p>
<p>‘No matter,’ quoth he, ‘but tell me all your grief.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ quoth the friar, ‘an odious mischief</p>
<p>This day befell my order and me,</p>
<p>And so, per consequens, each degree</p>
<p>Of Holy Church, may God amend it soon!’</p>
<p>‘Sire,’ quoth the lord, ‘you know what must be done.</p>
<p>Never upset yourself, you are my confessor.</p>
<p>You are the salt of the earth and the savour;</p>
<p>For God’s love, keep patience and unfold</p>
<p>Your grief to me.’ And he anon him told</p>
<p>What you have heard before – you know what.</p>
<p>The lady of the house all quietly sat</p>
<p>Till she had heard all that the friar said.</p>
<p>‘Ey, God’s mother,’ quoth she, ‘blessed maid!</p>
<p>Is there aught else? Tell me faithfully.’</p>
<p>‘Madame,’ quoth he, ‘what do you think, say free?’</p>
<p>‘What do I think?’ quoth she, ‘So God me speed,</p>
<p>I say a churl has done a churl’s deed.</p>
<p>What should I say? God help such as he!</p>
<p>His sick head is so full of vanity.</p>
<p>I swear he’s in a frenzy of some kind.’</p>
<p>‘Madame,’ quoth he, ‘by God, I shall find</p>
<p>Some means on him vengeance to wreak,</p>
<p>I shall slander him wherever I speak,</p>
<p>The false blasphemer that charged me</p>
<p>With sharing where sharing cannot be,</p>
<p>With each man alike, curse his ignorance!’</p>
<p>The lord sat still as he were in a trance,</p>
<p>And in his thought he rolled up and down:</p>
<p>‘How had this churl the imagination</p>
<p>To set such a problem for the friar?</p>
<p>Never before has ear heard such a matter;</p>
<p>I swear the devil put it in his mind!</p>
<p>In arithmetic no man could find</p>
<p>Before this day such a subtle question.</p>
<p>Who could enact a demonstration</p>
<p>Where every man should have his part</p>
<p>Of the sound and savour of a fart?</p>
<p>O foolish proud churl, I curse his face!</p>
<p>Lo sires,’ quoth the lord, ‘in bad grace,</p>
<p>Who ever heard of such a thing till now?</p>
<p>To every man alike – well tell me how!</p>
<p>It is impossible, it may not be.</p>
<p>Ey, foolish churl, God never prosper thee!</p>
<p>The rumbling of a fart, and every sound,</p>
<p>Is only air reverberating round,</p>
<p>And ever it wastes, bit by bit, away.</p>
<p>There is no man can judge, by my faith,</p>
<p>Whether it has been shared out equally.</p>
<p>What, lo my churl, lo yet how shrewdly</p>
<p>To my confessor today he answered back!</p>
<p>I hold him sure to be a demoniac.</p>
<p>Now eat your meat, and let the churl go play;</p>
<p>Let him go hang himself, and devil away!’</p>

<p>Now stood the lord’s squire at the board,</p>
<p>Who carved his meat, and heard every word</p>
<p>Of all the thing I’ve told you, which is true.</p>
<p>‘My lord,’ quoth he, ‘and not to displease you,</p>
<p>But I could tell, for a gown’s worth of cloth,</p>
<p>To you, sir friar, as long as you be not wrath,</p>
<p>How this fart might be divided equally</p>
<p>Among your convent, if it was up to me.’</p>
<p>‘Tell,’ quoth the lord, ‘and thou shall have anon</p>
<p>A gown’s worth, by God and by Saint John!’</p>
<p>‘My lord,’ quoth he, ‘when the weather’s fair,</p>
<p>Without wind or perturbation of the air,</p>
<p>Let them bring a cartwheel here into the hall.</p>
<p>But look that it have its spokes, one and all –</p>
<p>Twelve spokes has a cartwheel generally.</p>
<p>And bring me then twelve friars – why? You’ll see.</p>
<p>For thirteen make a convent, I would guess.</p>
<p>Your confessor here, for his worthiness,</p>
<p>Shall make up the number of this convent.</p>
<p>Then shall they kneel down, with their assent,</p>
<p>And to every spoke’s end in this manner</p>
<p>Full firmly lay his nose there shall a friar.</p>
<p>Your noble confessor, may God him save,</p>
<p>Shall hold his nose up right beneath the nave.</p>
<p>Then the churl, with belly stiff and taut,</p>
<p>As any drum, hither he shall be brought,</p>
<p>And set upon the wheel of the cart,</p>
<p>Upon the nave, the hub, and let him fart.</p>
<p>And you shall see, on peril of my head,</p>
<p>By proof demonstrative, as I have said,</p>
<p>That equally the sound of it will wend,</p>
<p>Just as the stink, to the spokes’ far end.</p>
<p>Save that this worthy man, your confessor,</p>
<p>Because he is a man of great honour,</p>
<p>Shall have the first fruit, as right it is.</p>
<p>The noble custom friars keep is this,</p>
<p>The worthiest of them shall first be served,</p>
<p>And certainly he has it well deserved.</p>
<p>He has taught us today so much good,</p>
<p>Preaching in the pulpit where he stood,</p>
<p>That I shall grant him, if it’s up to me,</p>
<p>The first smell of every fart, say three.</p>
<p>And so would all his convent, certainly;</p>
<p>He bears himself so fair and holily.’</p>
<p>The lord, the lady, and all save the friar,</p>
<p>Said that Jankin’s answer rated higher</p>
<p>Than any man’s but Euclid and Ptolemy.</p>
<p>As for the churl, they said that subtlety</p>
<p>And great wit made him answer back</p>
<p>In such a way, he was no demoniac.</p>
<p>And Jankin has won himself a new gown.</p>
<p>My tale is done; we’re almost in the town.</p>

<p>‘Sir Clerk of Oxford town,’ our Host said,</p>
<p>‘You ride as coy and quiet as a maid</p>
<p>Just newly wed, and sitting at the board.</p>
<p>From your tongue I haven’t heard a word;</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re pondering reason and rhyme.</p>
<p>But Solomon says “each thing has its time”.</p>
<p>For God’s sake, be now of better cheer!</p>
<p>The time for study is not now and here.</p>
<p>Tell us some merry tale, in God’s name;</p>
<p>For when a man has entered on a game,</p>
<p>He needs must to the game itself assent.</p>
<p>But preach not though, as friars do in Lent,</p>
<p>To make us for our past sins to weep,</p>
<p>Nor tell a tale that sends us all to sleep.</p>
<p>Tell us some merry thing of your adventures!</p>
<p>Your rhetoric, your flourishes, your figures,</p>
<p>Keep them in store until you come to write</p>
<p>In the high style, as men to monarchs might.</p>
<p>Speak out plainly at this time, we pray,</p>
<p>So we can understand all that you say.’</p>
<p>The worthy clerk answered him benignly:</p>
<p>‘Host,’ quoth he, ‘you hold authority,</p>
<p>For now you have of us the governance,</p>
<p>And therefore will I show obedience,</p>
<p>As far as reason goes, assuredly.</p>
<p>I will tell you a tale from Italy</p>
<p>I learned at Padua from a worthy clerk,</p>
<p>As proved by both his words and his work.</p>
<p>He is dead now, and nailed up in his chest;</p>
<p>I pray to God to grant his spirit rest!</p>
<p>Francis Petrarch, the laureate poet,</p>
<p>This clerk was called, whose rhetoric sweet</p>
<p>Illumined all Italy with poetry</p>
<p>As Lignano did in philosophy,</p>
<p>And law, and other art particular.</p>
<p>But death, that will allow no lingering here</p>
<p>As it were in the twinkling of an eye,</p>
<p>Has slain them both, as we all shall die.</p>
<p>But to tell briefly of the learned man</p>
<p>That taught me this tale, as I began</p>
<p>I say that first his style climbs the heights,</p>
<p>Before the body of his tale he writes,</p>
<p>A preface in which described we see</p>
<p>Piedmont, and Saluzzo, in that country,</p>
<p>And then the Apennines, hill scenery</p>
<p>That sets the bounds to western Lombardy,</p>
<p>And Viso, especially, the mountain</p>
<p>Where the Po from a little fountain</p>
<p>Springs, and from which it takes its source,</p>
<p>That eastward flows swelling in its course</p>
<p>To Emilia, Ferrara, and Venice,</p>
<p>Which would be a long thing to devise.</p>
<p>And truly, in my own poor judgement</p>
<p>I think it is a thing that is irrelevant,</p>
<p>Except to frame a setting for his matter.</p>
<p>But here’s his tale, as you now shall hear.</p>


<p>There is, on the west side of Italy,</p>
<p>Down at the root of Viso the cold,</p>
<p>A rich plain, known for its fertility,</p>
<p>Where many a tower and town you may behold</p>
<p>Founded in ancestral times of old,</p>
<p>And many another fine, noble sight;</p>
<p>Saluzzo its name, a landscape of delight.</p>
<p>A Marquis there was, once, lord of this land,</p>
<p>As were his worthy ancestors before,</p>
<p>And obedient, always ready to his hand,</p>
<p>Were all his subjects, both less and more.</p>
<p>Thus in delight he lived, in days of yore,</p>
<p>Beloved and feared, by favour of Fortune,</p>
<p>Both by his lords, and all of his commune.</p>
<p>And to that, you may add his lineage,</p>
<p>Being noblest born of Lombardy;</p>
<p>A fair person, strong and young in age,</p>
<p>And full of honour and of courtesy,</p>
<p>Discreet enough to rule all the country –</p>
<p>Save, in a few things he was to blame.</p>
<p>And Walter was this young lord’s name.</p>
<p>I blame him thus, that he never thought</p>
<p>Of what events the future might provide,</p>
<p>But present pleasure was the thing he sought,</p>
<p>Such as to hawk and hunt on every side.</p>
<p>Nigh every other care he would let slide.</p>
<p>And he would – and this was worst of all –</p>
<p>Wed no wife, whatever might befall.</p> 
<p>This thing alone his people felt so sore</p>
<p>That in a flock one day to him they went;</p>
<p>And one of them who wisest was in lore –</p>
<p>Or else the man most fit to win assent</p>
<p>From his lord, and tell him what they meant,</p>
<p>Or one who could well justify their fears –</p>
<p>He to the Marquis spoke as you shall hear:</p>
<p>‘O noble Marquis, your humanity</p>
<p>Gives us assurance, adds to our boldness,</p>
<p>Whenever the demands of necessity</p>
<p>Force us to tell you of our sadness.</p>
<p>Accept then, lord, of your graciousness,</p>
<p>What we with sorrowful hearts explain,</p>
<p>And let your ears not my voice disdain.</p>
<p>Though I have naught to do in this matter</p>
<p>More than another man in this place,</p>
<p>Yet, inasmuch as you, my master dear,</p>
<p>Have always shown me favour and grace,</p>
<p>I dare the better ask of you a space</p>
<p>Of audience, to tell of our request;</p>
<p>Then you, my lord, shall do as you think best.</p>
<p>For surely lord, so well do we like you</p>
<p>And all your works, and ever have, that we</p>
<p>Could not indeed ourselves imagine how</p>
<p>We might live in greater felicity,</p>
<p>Save one thing, lord, if such your will might be:</p>
<p>That you should be a wedded man were best –</p>
<p>Then were your folk in sovereign heart’s rest!</p> 
<p>Bow your neck beneath that blissful yoke</p>
<p>Of sovereignty and not in slavery’s guise,</p>
<p>Which men do call espousal, or wedlock.</p>
<p>And think, my lord, among your thoughts wise,</p>
<p>How all our days slip past, in sundry wise;</p>
<p>For though we sleep, or wake, or roam, or ride,</p>
<p>Time flees away; it nowhere will abide.</p>
<p>And though your green youth flowers bright,</p>
<p>In creeps age always, quiet as a stone.</p>
<p>And death may menace every age, and smite</p>
<p>In every state, for there escape it none.</p>
<p>And also certainly we know, each one,</p>
<p>That we shall die, as uncertain are we all</p>
<p>Of the one day on which our death shall fall.</p>
<p>Accept you now, in us, our true intent,</p>
<p>Who never yet refused your behest.</p>
<p>And, lord, we will, if that you should assent,</p>
<p>Choose you a wife, speedily, for the best,</p>
<p>Of the gentlest born, and of the highest</p>
<p>Of all this land, so that we might bring</p>
<p>Honour to God and you, in all this thing.</p>
<p>Deliver us out of all our care and dread,</p>
<p>And take a wife, for the high God’s sake!</p>
<p>For if it so befell, as God forbid,</p>
<p>That through your death your line should forsake</p>
<p>Our land, and a strange successor take</p>
<p>Your heritage, O, woe to us alive!</p>
<p>Wherefore we beg you hastily to wive.’</p> 
<p>Their humble prayer and their pious fear</p>
<p>Filled the Marquis’ heart with clemency.</p>
<p>‘Your wish,’ quoth he, ‘my own people dear,</p>
<p>Is one I never thought would constrain me.</p>
<p>I have rejoiced in all that liberty,</p>
<p>That seldom is experienced in marriage.</p>
<p>Where I was free, there I must find bondage.</p>
<p>Yet nonetheless, I see your true intent,</p>
<p>And trust to your wisdom, any day.</p>
<p>Wherefore, of my free will, I do assent</p>
<p>To being wed, as soon as ever I may.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as you offered today</p>
<p>To choose a wife for me, I release</p>
<p>You of that task, and let that offer cease.</p>
<p>For God knows, children we often find</p>
<p>Are unlike their noble ancestors before.</p>
<p>Bounty comes all from God, not the line</p>
<p>Which engendered them, and them bore.</p>
<p>I trust in God’s bounty, and therefore</p>
<p>My marriage, my estate, and all the rest</p>
<p>I entrust to him; may he do as is best.</p>
<p>Leave me then to choose alone a wife;</p>
<p>That charge on me I will myself endure.</p>
<p>But I pray you, and charge you on your life,</p>
<p>Whatever wife I choose, you will be sure</p>
<p>To worship her while she lives, in your</p>
<p>Words and works, both here and everywhere,</p>
<p>As if she an Emperor’s daughter were.</p> 
<p>And furthermore, this shall you swear to me</p>
<p>Against my choice you will not moan or strive.</p>
<p>For since I shall forgo my liberty</p>
<p>At your request, as ever I may thrive,</p>
<p>Where my heart is set, there shall I wive.</p>
<p>And unless you assent in this manner,</p>
<p>I pray you, speak no more of the matter.’</p>
<p>With heartfelt willingness they swore assent</p>
<p>To all this thing – and no man said him nay –</p>
<p>Beseeching his grace, before they went,</p>
<p>That he would appoint them a certain day</p>
<p>For his espousal, as soon as ever he may.</p>
<p>For yet the people were somewhat in dread</p>
<p>Lest still the Marquis no wife would wed.</p>
<p>He chose a day, such as seemed him best,</p>
<p>On which he would be wed, of certainty,</p>
<p>And said he did all this at their request.</p>
<p>And they, both humbly and obediently,</p>
<p>Kneeling on their knees full reverently,</p>
<p>Thanked him; and thus they made an end</p>
<p>To their embassy, and home again did wend.</p>
<p>And thereupon he of his officers</p>
<p>Commanded that a feast they purvey,</p>
<p>And to his privy knights and squires</p>
<p>Such tasks gave them as in their duties lay.</p>
<p>And they did his commandments obey,</p>
<p>And each of them used all his diligence</p>
<p>To arrange the feast with reverence.</p>

<p>Not for from this palace, all honourable,</p>
<p>Where the Marquis prepared his marriage,</p>
<p>There stood a hamlet, its site delectable,</p>
<p>Where the poor folk dwelling in that village</p>
<p>Tended their homes and their pasturage,</p>
<p>And by their work and toil found sustenance</p>
<p>According as the earth gave them abundance.</p>
<p>Among these poor folk there dwelt a man</p>
<p>Who was considered poorest of them all;</p>
<p>But the high God sends sometimes, as he can,</p>
<p>His grace into a little ox’s stall.</p>
<p>Janicula the village did him call.</p>
<p>A daughter had he, fair to the sight,</p>
<p>And Griselda she was named aright.</p>
<p>And if one spoke of virtuous beauty,</p>
<p>Then was she the fairest under the sun.</p>
<p>For she was brought up in true poverty;</p>
<p>No sinful thought through her head had run.</p>
<p>More often of the well than of the tun</p>
<p>She drank, and in virtue sought to please,</p>
<p>Knowing much labour, and no idle ease.</p>
<p>But though the maiden tender was of age,</p>
<p>Yet in the depths of her virginity</p>
<p>There was a spirit both mature and grave.</p>
<p>And she in great reverence and charity</p>
<p>Her poor old father nurtured carefully.</p>
<p>A few sheep, while she spun, she kept;</p>
<p>She was never idle unless she slept.</p> 
<p>And when she homeward came, she would bring</p>
<p>Roots and herbs, and other such things, oft,</p>
<p>Which she sliced and seethed for their eating,</p>
<p>And made her bed full hard, and nothing soft.</p>
<p>And thus she kept her father’s heart aloft,</p>
<p>With every obedience, and that diligence</p>
<p>With which a child shows a father reverence.</p>
<p>Upon Griselda, this humble creature,</p>
<p>Full often had the Marquis set his eye</p>
<p>As he rode out to hunt, peradventure;</p>
<p>And when it chanced that her he did espy,</p>
<p>It was not wantonly but with a sigh</p>
<p>He cast his eyes on her, in that place</p>
<p>And would often ponder on her face,</p>
<p>Commend her virtue and womanliness,</p>
<p>In his heart, surpassing any he might</p>
<p>Have seen, of her young age, in all respects.</p>
<p>For though the people have no great insight</p>
<p>Into virtue, he had considered right</p>
<p>Deeply of her bounty, and thought he would</p>
<p>Wed her only, if ever wed he should.</p>
<p>The wedding day arrived, and yet none can</p>
<p>Say what woman among them it shall be.</p>
<p>At which marvel wondered many a man,</p>
<p>And said, if they were speaking privately:</p>
<p>‘Will our lord yet cling to his vanity?</p>
<p>Will he not wed? Alas, alas the while!</p>
<p>Why does he thus himself and us beguile?</p> 
<p>But nonetheless, the Marquis has them make</p>
<p>Of gems, all set in gold and in azure,</p>
<p>Brooches and rings for Griselda’s sake.</p>
<p>And of her clothes he takes the measure</p>
<p>From a maid full like to her in stature,</p>
<p>And other ornaments are fashioned, all</p>
<p>That to such a bride should rightly fall.</p>
<p>And the mid-morning of the very day</p>
<p>Approached, when the wedding would be.</p>
<p>And the whole palace was in full array,</p>
<p>Both hall and chamber, each in their degree.</p>
<p>Kitchens and pantries stuffed all with plenty</p>
<p>Delicious viands, and everything to see</p>
<p>Came from the furthest parts of Italy.</p>
<p>This royal Marquis, richly arrayed,</p>
<p>With lords and ladies in his company,</p>
<p>Whom to attend the feast had been bade,</p>
<p>And with all his retinue of chivalry,</p>
<p>And many a sound of sundry melody,</p>
<p>Unto the village of which I have told</p>
<p>In this array the nearest way they rode.</p>
<p>Griselda, God knows, all innocent,</p>
<p>That for herself was meant all this array,</p>
<p>To fetch water from the well she went,</p>
<p>Set to return as soon as ever she may;</p>
<p>For she had heard said, that on this day</p>
<p>The Marquis would wed, and if she might</p>
<p>She would happily see some of that sight.</p> 
<p>She thought: ‘I’ll with the other maidens stand,</p>
<p>Who are my comrades, at our door and see</p>
<p>The Marchioness, and therefore what’s on hand</p>
<p>I’ll finish at home as quickly as may be,</p>
<p>The labour, that is, which belongs to me,</p>
<p>And then I could at leisure her behold,</p>
<p>If she this way unto the castle rode.’</p>
<p>But as over the threshold she’d have gone,</p>
<p>The Marquis came and began for her to call,</p>
<p>And she set down her water-pot anon</p>
<p>Beside the threshold, in an ox’s stall,</p>
<p>And down upon her knees began to fall,</p>
<p>And with grave countenance knelt there, still,</p>
<p>Till she had heard what was the lord’s will.</p>
<p>The pensive Marquis talked to the maid</p>
<p>Full soberly, and spoke in this manner:</p>
<p>‘Where is your father, Griselda?’ he said.</p>
<p>And she with reverence, her features clear,</p>
<p>Answered: ‘Lord, he is already here.’</p>
<p>And in she goes without lingering,</p>
<p>And to the Marquis does her father bring.</p>
<p>He by the hand then took this aged man,</p>
<p>And said thus, when he had him on one side:</p>
<p>‘Janicula, I neither may nor can</p>
<p>My heart’s desire any longer hide.</p>
<p>If you accept whatever will betide,</p>
<p>Your daughter will I take, before I wend,</p>
<p>For my own wife, unto my life’s end.</p> 
<p>You love me, I know it well, for certain,</p>
<p>And you are my faithful liegeman born,</p>
<p>And all I wish myself, I dare to say,</p>
<p>You also wish, and especially therefore,</p>
<p>Say of the issue I mentioned before –</p>
<p>Whether you will unto that purpose draw,</p>
<p>To take me as your own son-in-law.’</p>
<p>The sudden news astonished him so</p>
<p>The man grew red, perplexed, all quaking</p>
<p>He stood; could hardly speak, although</p>
<p>These words emerged: ‘Lord, I am willing</p>
<p>It be as you wish, and against your liking</p>
<p>I will nothing; you are my lord so dear.</p>
<p>Just as you wish decide the matter here.’</p>
<p>‘Yet I desire,’ quoth the Marquis with a sigh,</p>
<p>‘That in your chamber I, and you and she</p>
<p>Have conversation; and would you know why?</p>
<p>So that I may ask her if she will be</p>
<p>My wife, and be guided then by me.</p>
<p>And all this should be done in your presence;</p>
<p>I must speak with you as our audience.’</p>
<p>And in the chamber while they were about</p>
<p>The marriage-treaty, of which you shall hear,</p>
<p>The people pressed around the house without,</p>
<p>And wondered at the decency and care</p>
<p>With which attentively she kept her father dear.</p>
<p>But well might Griselda wonder at the sight,</p>
<p>For never her eyes on such before did light.</p> 
<p>And no wonder that she was astonished,</p>
<p>To see so many guests about the place.</p>
<p>She was not use to being so distinguished,</p>
<p>Which caused her to gaze with pallid face.</p>
<p>But briefly then this matter to embrace,</p>
<p>Here are the words that the Marquis said</p>
<p>To this benign, true and faithful maid.</p>
<p>‘Griselda,’ he said, ‘you must understand</p>
<p>It is pleasing to your father and to me</p>
<p>That I wed you; and it may thus stand,</p>
<p>If, as I guess, you wish it so to be.</p>
<p>But these demands I make first,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘To which, since all is done in hasty guise,</p>
<p>Shall you agree, or it be otherwise.</p>
<p>I say you must be ready with good heart</p>
<p>To do my pleasure, and that I freely may,</p>
<p>Do as I think best, whether you laugh or smart,</p>
<p>And never must you grudge it, night or day,</p>
<p>And also when I say “yes”, never say “nay”,</p>
<p>Neither in words nor frowning countenance.</p>
<p>Swear this, and here I swear to our alliance.’</p>
<p>Wondering at his words, quaking for dread,</p>
<p>She said: ‘Lord, ignoble and unworthy</p>
<p>Am I of the honour that you me should bed.</p>
<p>But as you wish yourself, so then will I.</p>
<p>And here I swear that always till I die</p>
<p>Will I willingly in work or thought obey,</p>
<p>On pain of death, though I fear it always.’</p> 
<p>‘That is enough, Griselda mine,’ quoth he;</p>
<p>And forth he went with a face full sober</p>
<p>Out at the door, and after him came she,</p>
<p>And to the people he spoke in this manner:</p>
<p>‘That is my wife,’ quoth he, ‘standing there.</p>
<p>Honour her and love her too, I pray,</p>
<p>Whoever loves me; there is no more to say.’</p>


<p>And that nothing of her former gear</p>
<p>She should bring into his house, he bade</p>
<p>The women to undress the girl right there;</p>
<p>At which the ladies showed less than glad</p>
<p>To handle the clothes in which she was clad.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, this maiden bright of hue</p>
<p>Foot to head they clothed again all new.</p>
<p>Her hair then they combed, that lay un-tressed</p>
<p>Untidy, and with slender-fingers all</p>
<p>A crown on her head they gently pressed,</p>
<p>And decked her with jewels great and small.</p>
<p>On her array why should my story fall?</p>
<p>The throng scarce knew her in her loveliness</p>
<p>When she transformed was by such richness.</p>
<p>The Marquis has espoused her with a ring</p>
<p>Brought for that very reason, and then her set</p>
<p>Upon a snow-white horse and gently ambling,</p>
<p>To his palace, without delay or fret,</p>
<p>With joyful people who her led and met,</p>
<p>Conveyed her; and thus the day they spend</p>
<p>In revel, till they see the sun descend.</p> 
<p>And briefly for this tale to embrace,</p>
<p>I say, that to this new marchioness</p>
<p>God had such favour sent her of his grace</p>
<p>That it seemed of the unlikeliest</p>
<p>That she had been born and fed in lowliness,</p>
<p>Such as in a cottage or an ox’s-stall,</p>
<p>But rather nourished in an Emperor’s hall.</p>
<p>To everyone she became so dear</p>
<p>And revered, that folk where she was born,</p>
<p>Who from her birth had known her year by year,</p>
<p>Scarcely believed, though once they’d sworn,</p>
<p>That to Janicle, of whom I spoke before,</p>
<p>She was daughter, for by all conjecture</p>
<p>They thought she was quite another creature.</p>
<p>For though ever virtuous was she,</p>
<p>She had so increased in excellence</p>
<p>Of good qualities, and high nobility,</p>
<p>Was so discrete and fair in eloquence,</p>
<p>So benign, and worthy of reverence,</p>
<p>And could the people’s heart so embrace,</p>
<p>That all loved her who looked upon her face.</p>
<p>Not only in Saluzzo, in the town,</p>
<p>Was published the virtue of her name,</p>
<p>But also beside in many a region.</p>
<p>If one spoke well, another did the same.</p>
<p>So spread of her high virtue the fame</p>
<p>That men and women, young as well as old,</p>
<p>Went to Saluzzo her face to behold.</p> 
<p>Thus Walter wedded humbly – yet royally –</p>
<p>And wedded with fortunate nobility,</p>
<p>In God’s peace lived full happily</p>
<p>At home, and outward grace enough had he.</p>
<p>And because he saw that in low degree</p>
<p>Virtue was often hid, people held him</p>
<p>For a prudent man, as is held seldom.</p>
<p>Griselda not only through her wit</p>
<p>Knew all the arts of wifely homeliness,</p>
<p>But also, when the case might require it,</p>
<p>The common cause too could she address.</p>
<p>There was no discord, rancour, sadness</p>
<p>In all that land that she could not ease,</p>
<p>And wisely bring them all to rest and peace.</p>
<p>And if her husband were absent, anon,</p>
<p>When noblemen or others of that country</p>
<p>Were wrath, she would make them atone.</p>
<p>Such wise and ripe phrases had she,</p>
<p>And judgement so filled with equity,</p>
<p>Men thought such as she the Heavens send</p>
<p>To save the people, and every wrong amend. </p>
<p>It was not long after this Griselda</p>
<p>Was wedded, that she a daughter bore.</p>
<p>Though she would have had a boy-child rather,</p>
<p>Glad was the Marquis still as all folk saw.</p>
<p>For though a maid child had come before,</p>
<p>She might still a boy-child yet achieve</p>
<p>Not being barren, so they all believed.  </p> 

<p>There befell, as it befalls often, though,</p>
<p>When the child had sucked a month or so</p>
<p>The Marquis in his heart longed, I owe,</p>
<p>To tempt his wife, her constancy to know,</p>
<p>And he could not out of his thoughts throw</p>
<p>This marvellous desire, his wife to test;</p>
<p>Needlessly, God knows, as I contest!</p>
<p>He had tried her well enough before,</p>
<p>And found her always good; what needed it</p>
<p>To tempt her, and always more and more,</p>
<p>Though some might praise his subtle wit?</p>
<p>As for me, I say evil we admit</p>
<p>In testing a wife when there is no need,</p>
<p>And placing her in pain and dread indeed.</p>
<p>The Marquis wrought it in this manner:</p>
<p>He came alone at night to where she lay,</p>
<p>With a stern face, he troubled did appear,</p>
<p>And then: ‘Griselda,’ quoth he, ‘that day</p>
<p>When I took you from your poor array,</p>
<p>And set you in a state of nobleness –</p>
<p>Have you forgotten it, as I would guess?</p>
<p>I say Griselda, this present dignity,</p>
<p>To which I have raised you, I vow,</p>
<p>Cannot have made you forgetful be</p>
<p>That I took you from your estate full low,</p>
<p>With all the little wealth you might know.</p>
<p>Take heed of every word I say to you;</p>
<p>There is no one to hear us but us two.</p> 
<p>You well know yourself how you came here</p>
<p>Into this house; it was not long ago.</p>
<p>And though to me you are prized and dear,</p>
<p>Among my noblemen you are not so.</p>
<p>They say it is great shame to them and woe</p>
<p>To be subject, and to live in bondage,</p>
<p>To you who are born of a small village.</p>
<p>And especially since you your daughter bore</p>
<p>These words have been spoken, more not less.</p>
<p>Yet I desire, as I have done before,</p>
<p>To live my life with them in peace and rest.</p>
<p>I may not in this case be deemed reckless;</p>
<p>I must do with your daughter, still</p>
<p>Not as I would, but as my people will.</p>
<p>And yet, God knows, it’s painful to me.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, without your knowing</p>
<p>I will do nothing, but this I wish,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘That you assent with me to all this thing.</p>
<p>Show your patience now in your being</p>
<p>That you swore to me in your village,</p>
<p>The day that we agreed our marriage.</p>
<p>When she had heard all this, she received</p>
<p>It all unchanged in word or countenance,</p>
<p>For, as it seemed, she was not aggrieved.</p>
<p>She said: ‘Lord, all power is in your glance.</p>
<p>My child and I, with true obedience,</p>
<p>Are all yours, and you may save or kill</p>
<p>Your own things: work then as you will.</p> 
<p>There can be nothing, God my soul save,</p>
<p>That you desire that may displease me;</p>
<p>No I require nothing for to have</p>
<p>Nor dread to lose, save only thee.</p>
<p>Your will in my heart shall ever be;</p>
<p>No length of time nor death may this deface,</p>
<p>Nor direct my thoughts to another place.’</p>
<p>Glad was the Marquis at her answering,</p>
<p>But yet he feigned as if he were not so.</p>
<p>All dreary was his face and his looking</p>
<p>When that he would out of the chamber go.</p>
<p>Soon after this, a few moments or so,</p>
<p>He secretly had told all his intent</p>
<p>Unto a man, and to his wife him sent.</p>
<p>A sort of servant was this confidant,</p>
<p>As faithful a man as ever he had</p>
<p>In things great, and such folk also can</p>
<p>Do execution in things that are bad;</p>
<p>The lord knew he loved him from a lad.</p>
<p>And when this sergeant knew his lord’s will,</p>
<p>Into the chamber he stole quiet and still.</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘you must forgive me,</p>
<p>If I do a thing to which I am constrained.</p>
<p>You are so wise that you will clearly see</p>
<p>A lord’s command must ever be attained.</p>
<p>It may well be lamented and complained</p>
<p>But all men must his desire obey.</p>
<p>And so will I; there is no more to say.</p> 
<p>This child I am commanded for to take.’</p>
<p>– And spoke no more, but grasped the child then</p>
<p>Violently, and a vile face he did make</p>
<p>As though he would have slain it as he went.</p>
<p>Griselda must endure all and consent,</p>
<p>And as a lamb she sat meek and still,</p>
<p>And let this cruel sergeant do his will.</p>

<p>Suspicious the reputation of this man,</p>
<p>Suspect his face, suspect his word also,</p>
<p>Suspect the time at which he thus began.</p>
<p>Alas, her daughter that she loved so,</p>
<p>She thought he would slay her though!</p>
<p>But nonetheless, she neither wept nor sighed,</p>
<p>Conforming to whatever might betide.</p>
<p>But at the last to speak she began,</p>
<p>And humbly to the sergeant replied,</p>
<p>That as he was a worthy nobleman,</p>
<p>To let her kiss her child before he slay it.</p>
<p>And in her lap the little child she laid it</p>
<p>With full sad face, and began to bless</p>
<p>And lull it, and after began to kiss.</p>
<p>And thus she said, in her gentle voice:</p>
<p>‘Farewell, my child! I never you shall see.</p>
<p>But since I have marked you with the cross</p>
<p>Of your Father – blessed must He be –</p>
<p>That for us died upon the cross-tree,</p>
<p>Your soul, little child, may He now take,</p>
<p>For this night shall you die for my sake.’</p> 
<p>I think that for a nurse, if one there was,</p>
<p>It would have been hard this sight to see;</p>
<p>Well might a mother then have cried ‘alas!’</p>
<p>But nonetheless, so firm steadfast was she</p>
<p>That she endured all adversity;</p>
<p>And to the sergeant humbly she said,</p>
<p>‘Have here again your sweet little maid.</p>
<p>Go now,’ quoth she, ‘and do my lord’s behest.</p>
<p>But one thing I pray you of your grace,</p>
<p>Unless my lord forbade it you, at least</p>
<p>Bury this little body in some place</p>
<p>Where neither birds nor beasts may it deface.’</p>
<p>But he no word to that request would say,</p>
<p>But took the child and went on his way.</p>
<p>The sergeant came unto his lord again,</p>
<p>And told him how Griselda did appear</p>
<p>In this, her words, the details short and plain,</p>
<p>Delivering to him her daughter dear.</p>
<p>The lord showed some pity in his manner,</p>
<p>But nonetheless his purpose held he still,</p>
<p>As lords do when they must have their will.</p>
<p>And bade the sergeant that he secretly</p>
<p>Should the child gently take and wrap,</p>
<p>In every circumstance all tenderly,</p>
<p>And carry it in a cradle or his lap –</p>
<p>But upon pain of death, by no mishap</p>
<p>Allow any man to know of his intent,</p>
<p>Nor whence he came, nor whither he went –</p> 
<p>But to Bologna, to his sister dear,</p>
<p>That at this time of Panico was countess,</p>
<p>He should it take and tell her of the matter,</p>
<p>Beseeching her to make it her business</p>
<p>To foster this child with all gentleness.</p>
<p>And whose child it was he bade her hide</p>
<p>From everyone, whatever might betide.</p>
<p>The sergeant went, and fulfilled this thing;</p>
<p>But to the Marquis at this time turn we.</p>
<p>For now he goes about wondering</p>
<p>If from his wife’s face he might see,</p>
<p>Or by her words perceive, whether she</p>
<p>Had changed at all; but never could he find</p>
<p>Her anything but steadfast ever and kind.</p>
<p>As glad, as humble, as eagerly she plies</p>
<p>Service, loving, as she was wont to be,</p>
<p>To him in every manner, and every guise.</p>
<p>Nor of her daughter a word spoke she.</p>
<p>No outward sign of her adversity</p>
<p>Was seen in her, nor ever her daughter’s name</p>
<p>Did she speak, in earnest or in game.</p> 

<p>In this state they reached the fourth year</p>
<p>Before she was with child, God us hold,</p>
<p>A boy child she bore to this Walter,</p>
<p>Full gracious and full fair to behold.</p>
<p>And when the father by his folk is told,</p>
<p>Not only he, but his folk in all the ways</p>
<p>Cheer this child, and God they thank and praise.</p>
<p>When it was two years old, and from the breast</p>
<p>Weaned by its nurse, on a certain day</p>
<p>The Marquis with another whim was blessed</p>
<p>To test his wife once more now, if he may.</p>
<p>O needlessly was she tested in this way!</p>
<p>But married men never keep wise measure</p>
<p>Whenever they find a patient creature.</p>
<p>‘Wife,’ quoth the Marquis, ‘you have heard ere this</p>
<p>My people still resent our marriage day;</p>
<p>And especially since my son new-born is,</p>
<p>It is worse than ever in every way.</p>
<p>The mutterings my heart and spirit slay,</p>
<p>For to my ears comes the deadly smart</p>
<p>Of that voice, and nigh destroys my heart.</p>
<p>Now they speak thus: “When Walter is gone,</p>
<p>Then shall the blood of Janicle succeed</p>
<p>And be our lord, for other have we none.”</p>
<p>Such my people speak, in fear indeed.</p>
<p>I must of such murmurs take full heed,</p>
<p>For certainly I dread such muttering,</p>
<p>Though they will not say it in my hearing.</p> 
<p>I would live in peace if I but might.</p>
<p>And therefore am decided utterly,</p>
<p>That as I served his sister by night,</p>
<p>Right so think I to serve him, secretly.</p>
<p>This I warn you of, so that suddenly</p>
<p>You with woe might not be outraged;</p>
<p>Be patient, and towards that I you pray.’</p>
<p>‘I have,’ quoth she, ‘said thus, and ever shall:</p>
<p>I wish for nothing, nothing, I say again,</p>
<p>But as you wish; naught grieves me at all</p>
<p>Though my daughter and my son be slain –</p>
<p>At your commandment, that is to say.</p>
<p>I have had no part of my children twain</p>
<p>Save first sickness, and then woe and pain.</p>
<p>You are our lord; do with your own things</p>
<p>Just as you wish; ask no advice of me.</p>
<p>For as I left at home all my clothing</p>
<p>When first I came to you, then so,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘I left my will and all my liberty,</p>
<p>And donned clothes of yours, wherefore I pray,</p>
<p>Do your pleasure; I will your wish obey.</p>
<p>And certainly if I’d had prescience</p>
<p>To know your will ere you your will told</p>
<p>I would have done it without negligence.</p>
<p>But now I know your wish and it behold,</p>
<p>To your pleasure all firmly I will hold.</p>
<p>For if I knew my death would bring you ease,</p>
<p>Right gladly would I die, you to please.</p> 
<p>For death is nothing in comparison</p>
<p>To your love.’ And when the Marquis knew</p>
<p>His wife’s constancy, then he cast down</p>
<p>His eyes two, and then he wondered too</p>
<p>That she in patience suffered all this rue.</p>
<p>And off he went with dreary countenance,</p>
<p>But in his heart his spirit was enhanced.</p>
<p>The ugly sergeant, in the same wise</p>
<p>That he her daughter snatched, so did he –</p>
<p>Or worse, if men a worse can devise –</p>
<p>Take her son that full was of beauty.</p>
<p>And, ever at one, so patient was she,</p>
<p>That she showed no look of sadness,</p>
<p>But kissed her son, and after did him bless.</p>
<p>Save this: she begged him that he might</p>
<p>For her little son fashion him a grave,</p>
<p>His tender limbs, delicate to sight,</p>
<p>From wild beasts and birds for to save.</p>
<p>But he no answer to her prayer gave;</p>
<p>He went his way as if he heard her not.</p>
<p>But to Bologna tenderly it brought.</p>
<p>The Marquis wondered, ever the more,</p>
<p>At her great patience then, and if he</p>
<p>Had not known truly that all before</p>
<p>Her children so perfectly loved she,</p>
<p>He would have thought that in some subtlety</p>
<p>Either of malice or of cruel spirit  </p>
<p>She had endured all this with sad visage.</p> 
<p>Yet he knew that next to himself again,</p>
<p>She loved her children best in every wise.</p>
<p>But now women would I ask right plain</p>
<p>If all these trials might not now suffice?</p>
<p>What could a harsh husband more devise</p>
<p>To prove her wifehood and her steadfastness,</p>
<p>While he continued ever in his harshness?</p>
<p>But there are folk of such inclination,</p>
<p>That when a certain end they undertake,</p>
<p>They cannot fall short of their intention,</p>
<p>But as though they were bound to the stake,</p>
<p>They never will their first pledge break.</p>
<p>Just so this Marquis here fully proposed</p>
<p>To test his wife, as he was first disposed.</p>
<p>He waits to see, will word or countenance</p>
<p>Betray that she has changed towards him, waits</p>
<p>But never can detect a variance;</p>
<p>She was at one in heart as in visage.</p>
<p>And the truer was, the more she aged,</p>
<p>If ever such a thing were possible,</p>
<p>To him in love, and the more dutiful.</p>
<p>So that it seemed, between the two</p>
<p>There was but one will, for as Walter wished</p>
<p>The same desire was her pleasure too.</p>
<p>And, God be thanked, all was for the best.</p>
<p>She well showed, despite the world’s unrest,</p>
<p>A wife, for herself then, nothing should</p>
<p>Will in effect, but as her husband would.</p> 
<p>Ill report of Walter was widely spread,</p>
<p>That with a cruel heart he, wickedly,</p>
<p>Because a poor woman he chose to wed,</p>
<p>Had murdered both his children secretly.</p>
<p>Such was the word among them generally.</p>
<p>No wonder is it, for to the people’s ear</p>
<p>There came no word, but that they murdered were.</p>
<p>At which, whereas the people there before</p>
<p>Had loved him well, the ill-report for shame</p>
<p>Made them hate him bitterly, and more.</p>
<p>The name of murderer is a hateful name;</p>
<p>But nonetheless, in earnest not in game,</p>
<p>He on his cruel purpose still was bent;</p>
<p>To test his wife was still his set intent.</p>
<p>When his daughter was twelve years of age,</p>
<p>He to the court of Rome, in subtle wise</p>
<p>Informed of his intent, sent his message</p>
<p>Commanding them such bulls to devise</p>
<p>As for his cruel purpose might suffice:</p>
<p>Stating the Pope, to set men’s minds at rest,</p>
<p>Bade him to wed again, as he thought best.</p>
<p>I say he bade them to counterfeit</p>
<p>The Pope’s bulls, there making mention</p>
<p>That he had leave his first wife to reject,</p>
<p>According to the Papal dispensation</p>
<p>To calm all the rancour and dissension</p>
<p>Between him and his people; thus the bull,</p>
<p>Which they then made public, and in full.</p> 
<p>The common people, as is no wonder,</p>
<p>Thought indeed these things were truly so.</p>
<p>But when the tidings came to Griselda,</p>
<p>I deem that her heart was full of woe,</p>
<p>But she, as steadfastly as ever though,</p>
<p>Was disposed, this humble creature,</p>
<p>The adversity of Fortune to endure.</p>
<p>Abiding ever his will and pleasure</p>
<p>He to whom she was given, heart and all,</p>
<p>As if to her content, in worldly measure.</p>
<p>But briefly, since this story tell I shall,</p>
<p>The Marquis now wrote an especial</p>
<p>Letter, in which he revealed his intent,</p>
<p>Then secretly to Bologna had it sent.</p>
<p>The Earl of Panico, the noble who</p>
<p>Had wedded his sister, especially</p>
<p>He begged to bring back his children two,</p>
<p>In honourable state all openly.</p>
<p>But one thing he asked specifically,</p>
<p>That, though men enquire, he give no answer</p>
<p>To those who asked whose children they were,</p>
<p>Saying the maiden now would wedded be</p>
<p>To the Marquis of Saluzzo, right anon.</p>
<p>And as the Earl was asked, so did he,</p>
<p>For on the day set, he on his way is gone</p>
<p>Towards Saluzzo, and lords many a one</p>
<p>In rich array, this maiden for to guide,</p>
<p>Her young brother riding by her side.</p> 
<p>Arrayed in clothes fit for her marriage</p>
<p>Was this fresh maid, decked in gems clear.</p>
<p>Her brother, who was seven years of age,</p>
<p>Also arrayed full freshly in his gear.</p>
<p>And so with great nobility they near</p>
<p>Saluzzo, towards which their journey lay,</p>
<p>From day to day, riding on their way.</p> 

<p>Meanwhile, following his wicked deed,</p>
<p>The Marquis, to try his wife yet more</p>
<p>To the furthest limits of loyalty,</p>
<p>And so gain knowledge, as before</p>
<p>As to the steadfastness he saw,</p>
<p>One day, and in open audience,</p>
<p>Bluntly pronounced this dread sentence:</p>
<p>‘Certainly, Griselda, it was pleasant</p>
<p>To take you as my wife for your goodness,</p>
<p>In that you were loyal and obedient –</p>
<p>And not for your lineage or riches.</p>
<p>But now the truth is here in its fullness,</p>
<p>For in great lordship, I realise,</p>
<p>There is great servitude, contrariwise.</p>
<p>I cannot do as any ploughman may;</p>
<p>My people are demanding that I take</p>
<p>Another wife: they moan day after day.</p>
<p>And the Pope determined, too, to slake</p>
<p>Their rancour, will consent I’ll undertake.</p>
<p>And in truth, this much to you I’ll say:</p>
<p>My new wife is already on her way.</p>
<p>Be strong of heart and vacate your place.</p>
<p>And the dower that you brought to me,</p>
<p>Take back again; I grant it of my grace.</p>
<p>Return now to your father’s house,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘None can forever know prosperity;</p>
<p>With calm heart I advise you to endure</p>
<p>The stroke of Fortune as you did before.’</p> 
<p>And she replied again, in her patience:</p>
<p>‘My lord, ‘quoth she, ‘I know as always,</p>
<p>That between your great magnificence</p>
<p>And my own poverty none can nor may</p>
<p>Make comparison, not in any way.</p>
<p>I never thought myself in any manner</p>
<p>Fit to be wife – nor yet to clean your chamber.</p>
<p>And in this house you me a lady made –</p>
<p>The high God take I for my witness,</p>
<p>And as surely as my soul he may save –</p>
<p>I never thought myself lady or mistress,</p>
<p>But humble servant to your worthiness,</p>
<p>And ever shall, while life may endure,</p>
<p>Far above all other worldly creatures.</p>
<p>That you so long of your generosity</p>
<p>Have held me in honour and always</p>
<p>Nobly, where I did not deserve to be,</p>
<p>That I thank God for, and you, I pray</p>
<p>He repay it you; there is no more to say.</p>
<p>Unto my father gladly will I wend,</p>
<p>And with him dwell unto my life’s end.</p>
<p>There was I fostered as a child so small,</p>
<p>My life there will I lead till I be dead,</p>
<p>A widow clean in body, heart and all.</p>
<p>For since I gave to you my maidenhead,</p>
<p>And am your true wife, it is no dread:</p>
<p>God forbid such a lord’s wife to take</p>
<p>Another man to husband, for his sake!</p> 
<p>And with your new wife God in his grace</p>
<p>Grant you happiness and prosperity;</p>
<p>For I will gladly yield to her my place,</p>
<p>In which I used so blissfully to be.</p>
<p>For since it is your wish, my lord,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘That once were to me all my heart’s rest,</p>
<p>That I should go, I’ll go as you think best.</p>
<p>And since you offer me such dower</p>
<p>As I first brought, it is then in my mind</p>
<p>That they were wretched clothes, not fair,</p>
<p>The which were hard now for me to find.</p>
<p>O good God, how gentle and how kind</p>
<p>You seemed, by your speech and visage,</p>
<p>The day that you took me in marriage!</p>
<p>But so it’s said – and now I find it true,</p>
<p>For in effect it is proved such by me –</p>
<p>Love is not, old, what once it was when new.</p>
<p>But, my lord, whatever the adversity,</p>
<p>Though death be in the case, it may not be</p>
<p>That ever in word or deed could I repent</p>
<p>Of giving you my heart with full intent.</p>
<p>My lord, you know that in my father’s place</p>
<p>You did me strip of all the clothes I had,</p>
<p>And richly clad me then, of your grace.</p>
<p>To you I brought naught else, be it said,</p>
<p>But faith, and nakedness, and maidenhead.</p>
<p>And here again your clothing I restore,</p>
<p>And your wedding ring for evermore.</p> 
<p>The rest of your jewels, lie readily</p>
<p>To hand in your chamber, I dare say.</p>
<p>Naked out of my father’s house,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘I came, and naked shall I go away.</p>
<p>All your wishes I’ll follow as always.</p>
<p>But yet I hope it would not be your intent</p>
<p>That I smock-less out of your palace went.</p>
<p>You could not do so shameful a thing</p>
<p>As let this womb in which your children lay</p>
<p>Be seen before the people in my walking</p>
<p>All bare; wherefore I to you do pray,</p>
<p>Let me not like a worm go by the way.</p>
<p>Remember now, my own lord so dear,</p>
<p>I was your wife, though all unworthy here.</p>
<p>In recompense then for my maidenhead,</p>
<p>Which I brought you, and no longer bear,</p>
<p>Vouchsafe a gift and grant me instead</p>
<p>Such a smock as I was wont to wear,</p>
<p>That I may clothe with it the womb of her</p>
<p>That was your wife; and here I take my leave</p>
<p>Of you, my own lord, lest I you grieve.’</p>
<p>‘The smock,’ quoth he, ‘that you have on your back,</p>
<p>Let it remain, and take it home with thee.’</p>
<p>But yet with difficulty he spoke, in fact,</p>
<p>And went away, in sadness, and with pity.</p>
<p>Before the folk then herself stripped she.</p>
<p>And in her smock, with head and foot all bare,</p>
<p>Towards her father’s house began to fare.</p> 
<p>The folk followed weeping, as she went by,</p>
<p>And they cursed Fortune everyone.</p>
<p>But she from weeping kept her eyes dry,</p>
<p>And all this time word spoke she none.</p>
<p>Her father, who the tidings heard anon,</p>
<p>Cursed the day and time that ever Nature</p>
<p>Created him to be a living creature.</p>
<p>For beyond doubt this poor old man</p>
<p>Had ever been suspicious of the marriage.</p>
<p>Because he deemed, since it all began,</p>
<p>That once the lord’s desires were assuaged,</p>
<p>He would consider that it disparaged</p>
<p>His status, on so lowly a girl to light,</p>
<p>And would reject her swiftly as he might.</p>
<p>To meet his daughter, hastily goes he,</p>
<p>For by folk’s noise he knew she was coming.</p>
<p>And with her old cloak, as it might be,</p>
<p>He covered her, full sorrowfully weeping.</p>
<p>But over her body he might not it fling,</p>
<p>For coarse was the cloth, and she in age</p>
<p>Owned many a day more than at her marriage.</p>
<p>So with her father, for a certain space,</p>
<p>Dwelt this flower of wifely patience,</p>
<p>Who neither by her words nor in her face</p>
<p>Before the folk, nor ever in their absence,</p>
<p>Showed that anyone had done offence</p>
<p>To her, nor showed she her remembrance</p>
<p>Of former high state, in her countenance.</p> 
<p>And no wonder, for in her high estate</p>
<p>Her spirit had shown but plain humility;</p>
<p>No luxurious tastes, no feelings delicate,</p>
<p>No pomp, no semblance there of royalty,</p>
<p>But she was full of patient benignity,</p>
<p>Discreet and void of pride, and honourable,</p>
<p>And to her husband ever meek and dutiful.</p>
<p>Men speak of Job, and of his humbleness,</p>
<p>Of which clerics, when they wish to, prattle</p>
<p>Regarding men especially, yet I stress,</p>
<p>Though clerks praise women but a little,</p>
<p>No man’s humility gains him acquittal,</p>
<p>As woman’s can, nor are men half so true</p>
<p>As women are, unless the world be new.</p>
<p>From Bologna the Earl of Panico’s come,</p>
<p>The news of which is spread to great and less;</p>
<p>And to the people’s ear, all and some,</p>
<p>It is made known a new marchioness</p>
<p>He’s brought with him, in pomp, such richness</p>
<p>That never a man’s eye might ever see</p>
<p>A nobler array in Western Lombardy.</p>
<p>The Marquis, who devised and knew it, he,</p>
<p>Ere that the Earl was come, sent a message</p>
<p>To his poor innocent Griselda, she</p>
<p>With humble heart and happy visage,</p>
<p>And not a proud thought in her spirit,</p>
<p>Came at his behest, kneeling at his feet,</p>
<p>And reverently and wisely did him greet.</p> 
<p>‘Griselda,’ quoth he, ‘my wish entirely</p>
<p>Is that this maid, who shall be wed to me,</p>
<p>Be received tomorrow as royally</p>
<p>As it is possible in my house to be;</p>
<p>And also that everyone in their degree</p>
<p>Be ranked fitly, seating and service-wise,</p>
<p>With noble pleasure, as best as I can devise.</p>
<p>I have no women capable, for certain,</p>
<p>Of attending to every circumstance</p>
<p>As I would wish, and therefore would fain</p>
<p>That of it yours was all the governance.</p>
<p>You know of old my will in every instance.</p>
<p>Though your array is but poor today,</p>
<p>Do your duty, and in the humblest way.’</p>
<p>‘I am not merely glad, lord,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘To do your will, but I desire also</p>
<p>To serve you and please you in my degree,</p>
<p>Without wearying, and will do so.</p>
<p>No never, whether in joy or woe,</p>
<p>Shall the spirit within my heart stint</p>
<p>To love you best, with all my true intent.’</p>
<p>With that she began to set the house aright,</p>
<p>And to lay the tables and beds to make,</p>
<p>And wearied herself to do all that she might,</p>
<p>Begging the chambermaids, for God’s sake,</p>
<p>To hasten, and quickly sweep and shake.</p>
<p>And she, willing to serve the most of all,</p>
<p>Arrayed every chamber and then the hall.</p> 
<p>About mid-morning did the Earl alight,</p>
<p>And brought the noble children that day,</p>
<p>While the people ran to see the sight</p>
<p>Of their splendour and their rich array.</p>
<p>And then among them first began to say</p>
<p>That Walter was no fool, though he wished</p>
<p>To change his wife, for it was for the best.</p>
<p>For she is fairer, and so deemed them all</p>
<p>Than Griselda, and tender is of age,</p>
<p>And fairer fruit between them shall fall,</p>
<p>And nobler, due to her high lineage.</p>
<p>Her brother too was of so fair a visage</p>
<p>The people were pleased in an instant,</p>
<p>Commending now the Marquis’ governance.</p>
<p>O storm-blown people, fickle and untrue,</p>
<p>Undiscerning, turning like a vane,</p>
<p>Delighting ever in all rumour new,</p>
<p>For like the moon itself, you wax and wane!</p>
<p>Full of chatter, worthy of all disdain!</p>
<p>Your judgement false, fitful in your ends;</p>
<p>A fool is he, who ever on you depends.</p>
<p>–  Thus said the grave folk in that city,</p>
<p>When the people gazed up and down,</p>
<p>For they were glad of the novelty,</p>
<p>To have a new lady in their town.</p>
<p>No more of this will I make mention,</p>
<p>But to Griselda again I make address,</p>
<p>And tell of her labours and her steadfastness.</p> 
<p>Griselda was busied with everything</p>
<p>That to the feast itself was pertinent.</p>
<p>Unembarrassed was she by her clothing,</p>
<p>Though it was coarse, and sorely rent,</p>
<p>But with glad face to the gate she went</p>
<p>With other folk, to greet the marchioness,</p>
<p>And after that she went about her business.</p>
<p>With a glad face his guests she received</p>
<p>And so skilfully, and all in their degree,</p>
<p>That no fault was by anyone perceived.</p>
<p>But ever they wondered who she might be</p>
<p>That in such poor array, as they could see,</p>
<p>Was capable of such honour and reverence</p>
<p>And were noble in praise of her prudence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile amongst all this she did not stint</p>
<p>The maid and her brother to commend</p>
<p>With all her heart, in her benign intent,</p>
<p>So much so no one could her praise amend.</p>
<p>But at the last, when that the lords went</p>
<p>To sit down to their meat, he began to call</p>
<p>Griselda, as she was busied in the hall.</p>
<p>‘Griselda,’ quoth he, as it were in play,</p>
<p>‘How like you my wife and her beauty?’</p>
<p>‘Right well,’ quoth she, ‘my lord, by my faith,</p>
<p>A fairer saw I never none than she.</p>
<p>I pray God to bring her prosperity;</p>
<p>And so hope I that he will to you send</p>
<p>Pleasure enough, until your lives end.</p> 
<p>One thing I beseech, in warning, though,</p>
<p>That you do not goad with your tormenting</p>
<p>This tender maid, as you have others so;</p>
<p>For she is fostered in her nourishing</p>
<p>More tenderly, and by my supposing,</p>
<p>She could never adversity endure</p>
<p>As could a basely fostered creature.’</p>
<p>And when Walter saw all her patience,</p>
<p>Her glad face, no malice there at all,</p>
<p>Though he had oft done to her offence,</p>
<p>And she as steadfast, constant as a wall,</p>
<p>Maintaining ever her innocence overall,</p>
<p>The Marquis in his heart could not repress</p>
<p>His pity for such wifely steadfastness.</p>
<p>‘It is enough, Griselda mine,’ quoth he;</p>
<p>‘Be now no more aghast nor dismayed.</p>
<p>I have your faith and your benignity,</p>
<p>As well as ever woman’s was, assayed,</p>
<p>In high estate, and in poverty arrayed.</p>
<p>I know, dear wife, your steadfastness by this!’</p>
<p>And took her in his arms then, with a kiss.</p>
<p>And she for wonder could not seem to keep</p>
<p>Her mind upon the things that he now said.</p>
<p>She was as one who starts up out of sleep,</p>
<p>Till all her bewilderment she might shed.</p>
<p>‘Griselda, by God who died in our stead,</p>
<p>You are my wife, no other do I have,</p>
<p>God save my soul,’ quoth he, ‘nor ever had!</p> 
<p>This your daughter, whom you have supposed</p>
<p>Would be my wife; the other, faithfully,</p>
<p>Shall be my heir, as I have pre-disposed;</p>
<p>And you have born him in your body, truly.</p>
<p>At Bologna have I kept them, secretly;</p>
<p>Take them again, for now you may believe</p>
<p>For neither of your children need you grieve!</p>
<p>And folk who otherwise have talked of me,</p>
<p>I tell them, that I did not do this deed</p>
<p>Out of malice, nor out of cruelty,</p>
<p>But to test your steadfastness, indeed,</p>
<p>And not to slay my children – God forbid! –</p>
<p>Only to keep them secretly and still,</p>
<p>Till I your purpose knew and all your will.’</p>
<p>When she heard this, swooning she did fall</p>
<p>For piteous joy, then after her swooning,</p>
<p>Both her young children to her did call,</p>
<p>And in her arms, all piteously weeping,</p>
<p>Embraced them, and tenderly kissing,</p>
<p>Now like a mother, with salt tears there</p>
<p>She bathed both her visage and her hair.</p>
<p>O, what a piteous thing it was to see</p>
<p>Her swooning and her humble voice to hear!</p>
<p>‘Graunt mercy, lord, God thank you,’ quoth she</p>
<p>‘That you have saved my children dear!</p>
<p>Now I care not if I should die, and here;</p>
<p>Since I have still your love and your grace,</p>
<p>No matter is it when death my spirit takes.</p> 
<p>O my young children, tender, and dear</p>
<p>Your sorrowful mother did think truly</p>
<p>That cruel hounds, or foul beast, for fear,</p>
<p>Had devoured you; but God, in his mercy,</p>
<p>And your benign father, so tenderly</p>
<p>Have kept you safe, and here you are found!</p>
<p>And suddenly she swooned to the ground.</p>
<p>And in her swoon so tightly held she</p>
<p>To her two children, whom she did embrace,</p>
<p>That only with skill and great difficulty</p>
<p>The children from her arms could they unlace.</p>
<p>Oh, many a tear on many a pitying face</p>
<p>Ran down the cheeks of those at her side;</p>
<p>Scarcely in her presence could they abide.</p>
<p>Walter comforts her, her sorrow slakes;</p>
<p>She rises up, confused, from her trance,</p>
<p>And everyone much of her feelings makes,</p>
<p>Till she is once again in countenance.</p>
<p>Walter dances on her such fine attendance</p>
<p>It is a true delight to see joy hover,</p>
<p>Between the two, now they are together.</p>
<p>The ladies, when the right moment came,</p>
<p>Took her away, to her chamber were gone,</p>
<p>And stripped her there of her coarse array,</p>
<p>And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,</p>
<p>And with a richly-jewelled royal crown</p>
<p>Upon her head, into the hall her brought,</p>
<p>And there she was honoured as she ought.</p> 
<p>Thus had this piteous day a blissful end,</p>
<p>For each man and woman, with all their might,</p>
<p>Sought the day in mirth and revel to spend,</p>
<p>Till in the welkin shone the starry light.</p>
<p>For far more noble then in each man’s sight</p>
<p>Was this feast, and richer in its display,</p>
<p>Than was the feasting on their marriage day.</p>
<p>Full many a year in high prosperity</p>
<p>These two lived, in concord and in rest,</p>
<p>And richly his daughter married he</p>
<p>Unto a lord, one of the worthiest</p>
<p>In all Italy; and then in peace and rest</p>
<p>His wife’s father in his court he kept,</p>
<p>Till the soul out of his body crept.</p>
<p>His son succeeded, and his heritage</p>
<p>Enjoyed in peace, after his father’s day,</p>
<p>And fortunate also was in his marriage –</p>
<p>Though he put his wife to no such assay.</p>
<p>Our world’s not so tough in fibre, nay,</p>
<p>As it seems to have been in days of yore.</p>
<p>And hearken what the author says therefore:</p>
<p>This story is told, not because wives could</p>
<p>Follow Griselda in her humility,</p>
<p>It would be unreasonable if they should;</p>
<p>But that everyone, in their degree,</p>
<p>Should yet be constant in adversity</p>
<p>As was Griselda – that is what Petrarch cites</p>
<p>Of the story, which in high style he writes.</p> 
<p>For since a woman showed such patience</p>
<p>To mortal man, then the more so we ought</p>
<p>To accept all willingly what God us sends.</p>
<p>For it is right He tries what he has wrought;</p>
<p>Yet tempts no man for whom His Son has bought</p>
<p>Redemption, as Saint James does truly say.</p>
<p>Though there’s no doubt, He tries folk every day.</p>
<p>And suffers us, as if for our exercise,</p>
<p>With sharp scourges of adversity,</p>
<p>To be scourged, full oft, in sundry wise;</p>
<p>Not though to prove our will, for He</p>
<p>Ere we are born knows all our frailty.</p>
<p>And for our best is all His governance;</p>
<p>Let us then live in virtuous sufferance.</p>
<p>But one word, lordings, hearken, ere I go:</p>
<p>It would be hard to find nowadays</p>
<p>Griseldas, in any city here below;</p>
<p>For if that they were put to such assay,</p>
<p>The gold in them is so alloyed, always,</p>
<p>With brass, that though the coin cheat the eye,</p>
<p>It would rather break in two than bend, say I.</p>
<p>With which here, for love of the Wife of Bath –</p>
<p>Whose life and all her sect may God maintain</p>
<p>In high mastery, or it were a pity, alas –</p>
<p>I will with lusty heart, fresh and green,</p>
<p>Sing you a song, to gladden you, I mean;</p>
<p>And let us finish all this serious matter.</p>
<p>Hear then my song that runs in this manner.</p> 

<p>Griselda is dead, and all her patience,</p>
<p>And both are buried now in Italian dale.</p>
<p>For which I cry to my audience,</p>
<p>Wedded men be not eager to assail</p>
<p>Your patient wives, in hopes to find</p>
<p>Griselda, for with certainty you’ll fail.</p>
<p>O noble wives, full of lofty prudence,</p>
<p>Allow not humility your tongue to nail!</p>
<p>And let no clerk have cause from diligence</p>
<p>To write of you a story that might entail</p>
<p>All that Griselda’s did, patient and kind,</p>
<p>Lest fabled cow wind you in her entrails!</p>
<p>Follow Echo, who never keeps her silence,</p>
<p>But ever answers you with hail for hail.</p>
<p>Do not be cowed in your innocence,</p>
<p>But take on you the mastery without fail.</p>
<p>Imprint this lesson deeply in your mind,</p>
<p>For common profit, since it may avail.</p>
<p>You arch-wives, be strong in your defence,</p>
<p>Since you are mighty as the camel hale;</p>
<p>Suffer no man to do you an offence.</p>
<p>And slender wives, feeble in war and frail,</p>
<p>Be fierce as the tigress, that in Inde we find;</p>
<p>Clack away like the mill, beneath the sail!</p>
<p>And dread them not, do them no reverence;</p>
<p>For though your husband be armed in mail,</p>
<p>The arrows of your forceful eloquence</p>
<p>Will pierce his breast and turn him pale.</p>
<p>With jealousy I’d advise that you him bind,</p>
<p>And then you’ll see him cower like a quail.</p> 
<p>If you are fair, in other folk’s presence</p>
<p>Show your face, and your apparel trail,</p>
<p>If you are foul, be free with your expense;</p>
<p>To get you friends, thus labour and travail.</p>
<p>Be light-hearted as a leaf, be blind,</p>
<p>And let him grieve, and weep, and wring, and wail!</p>

<p>‘Weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow,</p>
<p>I’ve known enough of, even-tide and morrow,’</p>
<p>Quoth the Merchant, ‘as do others though,</p>
<p>Who have been wed, I know that it is so,</p>
<p>Too well I see that’s how it fares with me.</p>
<p>I have a wife, the worst sort there may be;</p>
<p>For even though the fiend were to wed her,</p>
<p>She would outmatch him, I’d truly swear.</p>
<p>What should I especially for you recall</p>
<p>Of her deep malice? She’s a shrew in all!</p>
<p>There is a vast and a broad difference</p>
<p>Betwixt Griselda’s wondrous patience,</p>
<p>And my wife’s exceeding cruelty.</p>
<p>Were I free once more, I say to thee,</p>
<p>I would ever again avoid the snare.</p>
<p>We wedded men live in sorrow and care.</p>
<p>Try it who will, and he indeed shall find</p>
<p>That I say true, by Saint Thomas of Inde! –</p>
<p>Speaking for most of us; I don’t say all.</p>
<p>God forbid that ever that should befall!</p>
<p> Ah, good sir Host, I have wedded been</p>
<p>These two months, no more than that, you see;</p>
<p>And yet I know, he that all his life</p>
<p>Wifeless has been, could in no like manner</p>
<p>Tell so much sorrow as I now, here,</p>
<p>Could tell of my wife’s cussedness!’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ quoth our Host, ‘Merchant, so God you bless,</p>
<p>Since you know so much of all that art,</p>
<p>Full heartily I pray you, tell us part.’</p>
<p>‘Gladly,’ quoth he, ‘but of my own sore</p>
<p>Because my heart is sad, I’ll tell no more.’</p>

<p>Once there was, dwelling in Lombardy</p>
<p>A worthy knight, born in Pavia he,</p>
<p>In which he lived in great prosperity.</p>
<p>And sixty years a wifeless man, was free</p>
<p>To pursue all his bodily delight</p>
<p>With women, where lay his appetite,</p>
<p>As do these fools who are but secular.</p>
<p>And when he had passed his sixtieth year,</p>
<p>Whether from holiness, or in his dotage</p>
<p>I cannot say, but he was in such a rage,</p>
<p>This knight, to see himself a wedded man</p>
<p>That day and knight he ponders all he can</p>
<p>Seeking for how he might wedded be,</p>
<p>Praying Our Lord to grant him that he</p>
<p>Might once know all of the blissful life</p>
<p>That is between a husband and his wife,</p>
<p>And to live in that holy bond, tight bound,</p>
<p>In which God first man and woman wound.</p>
<p>‘No other life,’ said he, ‘is worth a bean;</p>
<p>For wedlock is so comfortable, I mean,</p>
<p>That in this world it seems a paradise.’</p>
<p>– So said this old knight who was so wise.</p>
<p>And certainly, as true as God is King,</p>
<p>To take a wife it is a glorious thing,</p>
<p>Especially when a man is old and hoar;</p>
<p>Then is a wife the fruit of all his hoard.</p>
<p>Then should he take a wife young and fair,</p>
<p>On whom he might engender an heir,</p>
<p>And all his life in joy and solace pass,</p>
<p>While all the bachelors may sing ‘alas!’</p>
<p>Where they are lost in the adversity</p>
<p>Of love which is but childish vanity.</p>
<p>And truly, it is fitting it should be so,</p>
<p>And bachelors have all the pain and woe.</p>
<p>On fragile base they build, fragility</p>
<p>They find when they would have security.</p>
<p>They live but as a bird or as a beast,</p>
<p>In liberty and free of any leash,</p>
<p>Yet a wedded man in his new state</p>
<p>Lives a life blissful and moderate,</p>
<p>Under this yoke of true marriage bound.</p>
<p>Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound;</p>
<p>For who shall be obedient as a wife?</p>
<p>Who is so true, and caring of his life</p>
<p>In sickness and in health, as is his mate?</p>
<p>For weal or woe she will not him forsake,</p>
<p>She never wearies, but will love and serve,</p>
<p>Though he lie bedridden while on this earth.</p>
<p>And yet some scholars say it is not so,</p>
<p>And Theophrastus he is one of those.</p>
<p>What matter if Theophrastus choose to lie?</p>
<p>‘For thriftiness,’ quoth he, ‘take not a wife,</p>
<p>In order to spare your household from expense.</p>
<p>A faithful servant will show more diligence</p>
<p>In nurturing your estate than your own wife,</p>
<p>For she will claim a half of it all her life.</p>
<p>And if you are sick, so God me save,</p>
<p>Your true friends, or an honest knave,</p>
<p>Will help you more than she that waits, I say</p>
<p>To own your goods, and has for many a day.</p>
<p>And if you take a wife to have and hold,</p>
<p>You may easily end up as a cuckold.’</p>
<p>This opinion, and a hundred worse,</p>
<p>Writes the man, may God his ashes curse!</p>
<p>But ignore all such, it’s vanity;</p>
<p>Defy Theophrastus, hearken unto me.</p>
<p>A wife is God’s gift, say I, verily.</p>
<p>All other kinds of gift, assuredly –</p>
<p>Such as lands, rents, pasture, rights in common,</p>
<p>Or movables – they are all gifts of Fortune,</p>
<p>Which vanish like the shadows on a wall.</p>
<p>But doubt not, plainly I shall speak to all,</p>
<p>A wife will last, and in your house endure,</p>
<p>Longer then you may wish, peradventure!</p>
<p>Marriage is a mighty sacrament;</p>
<p>He that has no wife is good as spent;</p>
<p>He lives helplessly and desolate –</p>
<p>I speak of folk in the secular state.</p>
<p>And listen why – I do not speak for naught –</p>
<p>Because woman was for man’s help wrought.</p>
<p>Great God, when he first Adam created,</p>
<p>And saw him all alone, and belly-naked,</p>
<p>God of his goodness said, as He had planned:</p>
<p>‘Let us create a helpmate for this man,</p>
<p>One like himself’ – and then created Eve.</p>
<p>Here may you see, and so may you believe,</p>
<p>A wife is a man’s help and consolation,</p>
<p>His terrestrial paradise and salvation.</p>
<p>So obedient and virtuous is she,</p>
<p>They cannot help but live in unity.</p>
<p>One flesh are they, and one flesh, I guess,</p>
<p>Has but one heart, in joy and in distress.</p>
<p>A wife – ah, Saint Mary, benedicitee!</p>
<p>How should a man then know adversity</p>
<p>Who has a wife? For sure, I cannot say.</p>
<p>The bliss between them both, night and day,</p>
<p>No tongue can tell about nor heart can think.</p>
<p>If he is poor, she labours, every wink;</p>
<p>She nurtures his goods, wastes not a shell.</p>
<p>All that her husband likes, she likes as well.</p>
<p>She never once says ‘nay’, when he says ‘yes’.</p>
<p>‘Do this,’ says he, ‘all ready, sire,’ she says.</p>
<p>O blissful order of true wedlock precious,</p>
<p>You are so happy and so virtuous,</p>
<p>Commended and approved, week by week,</p>
<p>That every man that’s worth more than a leek,</p>
<p>Upon his bare knees ought throughout his life</p>
<p>To thank the God who sent to him a wife,</p>
<p>Or else should pray to God that He might send</p>
<p>A wife to him, to endure till his life end,</p>
<p>For then he can live life in security</p>
<p>And not be troubled, as far as I can see,</p>
<p>As long as by his wife’s advice he’s led;</p>
<p>Then may he boldly hold aloft his head.</p>
<p>They are so true, and withal are so wise.</p>
<p>Thus, if you’d live as learned men advise,</p>
<p>Do always as the womenfolk shall cite.</p>
<p>Lo then, how Jacob, as the clerics write,</p>
<p>By good counsel of his mother, Rebecca,</p>
<p>Binds the kid’s skin round his neck, a</p>
<p>Ploy by which his father’s blessing’s won.</p>
<p>Lo, how Judith, for thus the stories run,</p>
<p>By wise counsel, God’s own people kept,</p>
<p>And slew King Holofernes while he slept.</p>
<p>Lo, how by Abigail’s good counsel she</p>
<p>Saved her own husband Nabal, when he</p>
<p>Looked to be slain; and Esther, she also</p>
<p>By good counsel delivered out of woe</p>
<p>The people of God, and had Mordecai</p>
<p>Enhanced by Ahasuerus in God’s eye.</p>
<p>There is no rank superior, in life,</p>
<p>Says Seneca, to that of humble wife.</p>
<p>Endure your wife’s tongue, as Cato has it;</p>
<p>She shall command, and you must endure it –</p>
<p>And yet she will obey out of courtesy.</p>
<p>A wife is the keeper of your property;</p>
<p>Well may the sick man wail and weep</p>
<p>When there is no wife the house to keep.</p>
<p>I warn you, if wisely you would work,</p>
<p>Love your wife well, as Christ loved his Church.</p>
<p>If you love yourself, then love your wife.</p>
<p>No man hates his flesh, but all his life</p>
<p>He nurtures it; and therefore bid I thee,</p>
<p>Cherish your wife, or never prosperous be.</p>
<p>Husband and wife, whatever men jesting say,</p>
<p>Among the worldly, keep to the safest way.</p>
<p>They are so knit, no harm may thus abide,</p>
<p>And especially upon the woman’s side.</p>
<p>So January considered, of whom I told,</p>
<p>For he, when the time came that he was old,</p>
<p>Thought of the pleasant life, the virtuous quiet,</p>
<p>That is marriage’s sweet and honeyed diet,</p>
<p>And for his friends thus one day he sent</p>
<p>To tell them the gist of all his fond intent.</p>
<p>With grave face this tale to them he told:</p>
<p>‘Friends,’ he said, ‘see, I am hoar and old,</p>
<p>And almost, God knows, on the grave’s brink;</p>
<p>Now, of my soul somewhat I must think.</p>
<p>I have my strength wantonly expended –</p>
<p>Blessed be God that this may be amended!</p>
<p>For I will, indeed, become a married man,</p>
<p>And that anon, with all the haste I can.</p>
<p>I’ll wed some maid, of fair and tender age,</p>
<p>I pray you, prepare you for my marriage</p>
<p>Swiftly now, for I cannot long abide.</p>
<p>And I will try to discover, on my side,</p>
<p>To whom I might be wedded rapidly.</p>
<p>But since there are more of you than me,</p>
<p>You are more likely such a one to spy</p>
<p>Than me, one with whom I might best ally.</p>
<p>But of one thing I warn you, my friends dear,</p>
<p>I will have no old wife, no, never fear.</p>
<p>She shall not be more than twenty, say,</p>
<p>Old fish but young flesh I’d have any day;</p>
<p>Better a pike,’ quoth he, ‘than a pickerel,</p>
<p>Yet fresh veal better than old beef is well.</p>
<p>I’d wish for no woman thirty years of age;</p>
<p>Such is but bedstraw and coarse for forage.</p>
<p>And old widows, God knows that they float</p>
<p>As trickily as did Wade’s fabled boat,</p>
<p>Making so much mischief when they wish,</p>
<p>That I’d never have a moment’s peace.</p>
<p>For as diverse schools make subtle clerics;</p>
<p>Woman, of many schools, part-scholar is.</p>
<p>But surely, a young thing men may guide,</p>
<p>As warm wax in the hands, readily plied.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I say plainly, in a single clause,</p>
<p>I will have no old wife, and here’s the cause.</p>
<p>For if it happened by some cruel mischance</p>
<p>I would find no pleasure in her glance,</p>
<p>And I’d end in adultery, by and by,</p>
<p>And go straight to the devil when I die.</p>
<p>No children on her should I then beget;</p>
<p>And I’d prefer my hounds to eat me yet</p>
<p>Rather than that my property should fall</p>
<p>Into strange hands, and this I tell you all.</p>
<p>I am not in my dotage; I know why</p>
<p>Men should be wed, and furthermore I</p>
<p>Know that many a man speaks of marriage</p>
<p>That knows no more than does my page,</p>
<p>Of why every man should take a wife –</p>
<p>If he cannot live chaste throughout his life –</p>
<p>Take him a wife with proper devotion</p>
<p>And for the sake of lawful procreation</p>
<p>Of children, to the honour of God above,</p>
<p>And not for passion only or for love;</p>
<p>And so that he might lechery eschew,</p>
<p>And pay his debt when it falls due;</p>
<p>Or so that each should help the other</p>
<p>In misery, as a sister does her brother,</p>
<p>And live in chastity full holily.</p>
<p>But, sires, that is not I, by your leave;</p>
<p>For, God be thanked, I dare to boast,</p>
<p>I feel my limbs stronger are than most,</p>
<p>Enough to do all that a man may do.</p>
<p>I know best myself what I can do, too.</p>
<p>Though I am hoary, I am like a tree</p>
<p>That blossoms white before the fruit, we see,</p>
<p>A blossoming tree is neither dry nor dead.</p>
<p>And I am only hoary on my head.</p>
<p>My heart and all my limbs are as green</p>
<p>As laurel all the year is sweetly seen.</p>
<p>And since you have heard all my intent,</p>
<p>I pray that you will, to my wish, assent.’</p>
<p>Various men variously him told</p>
<p>Of marriage, gave many examples old.</p>
<p>Some blamed it, and some praised it again;</p>
<p>But at the last, and briefly to explain,</p>
<p>As everyday occur fierce altercations</p>
<p>Between friends in their disputations,</p>
<p>A quarrel fell out between his friends so;</p>
<p>Of whom the one was called Placebo,</p>
<p>While Justinus, in truth, was the other.</p>
<p>Placebo said: ‘O January, my brother,</p>
<p>You have little need, my lord so dear,</p>
<p>To take counsel of anyone that’s here,</p>
<p>Unless being so full of sapience,</p>
<p>You’d dislike, of your noble prudence,</p>
<p>To stray far from the words of Solomon.</p>
<p>This is what he said to us, every one,</p>
<p>“Work everything by counsel” – so said he –</p>
<p>‘And then you’ll not repent latterly.”</p>
<p>But though Solomon spoke this word,</p>
<p>My own dear brother and my lord,</p>
<p>God in Heaven bring my soul to rest,</p>
<p>I hold your own counsel still the best.</p>
<p>For, brother mine, since opinion’s rife,</p>
<p>Well, I have been a courtier all my life,</p>
<p>And God knows, though I unworthy be,</p>
<p>I have served with those of high degree,</p>
<p>Amongst lords of the highest estate,</p>
<p>Yet with them I never would debate.</p>
<p>I never contradicted them, truly;</p>
<p>I well know my lord knows more than me.</p>
<p>Whatever he says, I hold it to be right;</p>
<p>On the same, or something similar, I light.</p>
<p>A mighty fool is any councillor</p>
<p>Who serves a lord with high honour,</p>
<p>Yet dares presume, or consider he is fit</p>
<p>To offer advice that betters his lord’s wit.</p>
<p>No, lords are not fools, no, by my faith!</p>
<p>You have shown yourself, here today</p>
<p>Of such noble thought, so holy and fine,</p>
<p>That I agree, endorse it all with mine,</p>
<p>All your words and all your true opinion.</p>
<p>By God, there is no man in all this town,</p>
<p>Nor in Italy, who could have spoken better!</p>
<p>Christ would be satisfied with every letter.</p>
<p>And truly it is a noble wish I say</p>
<p>For any man who is advanced in age</p>
<p>To take a young wife; by my father’s kin,</p>
<p>Your heart’s hanging from a trusty pin!</p>
<p>Do now in this matter as you wish,</p>
<p>For, in conclusion, I do think that best.’</p>
<p>Justinus, who sat still and all this heard,</p>
<p>In this manner Placebo he answered:</p>
<p>‘Now, my brother, be patient I pray,</p>
<p>Since you have spoken, hear now what I say.</p>
<p>‘Seneca, among other words, all wise,</p>
<p>Says indeed that a man is well advised</p>
<p>To ponder where he leaves his land and chattels.</p>
<p>And since therefore I ought to think right well</p>
<p>To whom I give my goods away, truly</p>
<p>I should consider still more carefully</p>
<p>To whom I give my body for many a day,</p>
<p>I warn you truly now, it’s no child’s play</p>
<p>To marry without due consideration.</p>
<p>Men must enquire – this is my opinion –</p>
<p>If she be wise, sober or drunken too,</p>
<p>Or proud, or else otherwise a shrew,</p>
<p>A chider, or a waster of your goods,</p>
<p>Rich or poor, a virago from the woods –</p>
<p>Although it’s true as ever no man shall</p>
<p>Find any in this world sound in all,</p>
<p>No man, no beast that man could devise.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it ought to suffice</p>
<p>For any wife, that one know if she had</p>
<p>More good qualities than she had bad.</p>
<p>And all this needs leisure to enquire.</p>
<p>For, God knows, I have wept tears entire</p>
<p>Days, privately, since I have had a wife.</p>
<p>Praise who will a married man’s life,</p>
<p>Be sure, I find in it but cost and care,</p>
<p>And duty, of all bliss and joy bare.</p>
<p>And yet, God knows, my neighbours all about,</p>
<p>And especially the women, I avow,</p>
<p>Say that I have a most constant wife,</p>
<p>And the meekest one that God gave life.</p>
<p>But I know best where pinches thus the shoe.</p>
<p>You can do, for my part, what pleases you.</p>
<p>Take thought – you are mature now in age –</p>
<p>Before you enter into any marriage,</p>
<p>Especially with a wife both young and fair.</p>
<p>By Him that made water, earth, and air,</p>
<p>The youngest man there is among the crowd</p>
<p>Is hard put to ensure, if he’s allowed,</p>
<p>His wife for himself alone. Trust in me,</p>
<p>You shall not please her fully years three –</p>
<p>That is to say, or give her satisfaction.</p>
<p>A wife demands plenty of attention.</p>
<p>With what I said, be not displeased I pray.’</p>
<p>‘Well, quoth January, ‘have you had your say?</p>
<p>That for your Seneca and your proverbs!</p>
<p>I care not a basketful of herbs</p>
<p>For scholar’s terms! Wiser men than thou,</p>
<p>As you know well, have assented now,</p>
<p>To my scheme. Placebo what say ye?’</p>
<p>‘I say it is a cursed man,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Indeed, who hinders true matrimony.’</p>
<p>And with that word they rose, suddenly,</p>
<p>And they assented fully that he should</p>
<p>Be wedded when he wished, and where he would.</p>
<p>Powerful imaginings, fresh anxiousness,</p>
<p>From day to day, full on the spirit pressed</p>
<p>Of January, concerning all this marriage.</p>
<p>Many a fair shape, many a fair visage,</p>
<p>There passed through his heart, night by night,</p>
<p>As one who took a mirror, polished bright,</p>
<p>And set it there in the public market-place,</p>
<p>Would see many a reflected figure pace</p>
<p>Across his mirror; and in similar wise</p>
<p>Could January in his own mind devise</p>
<p>Images of maids who dwelt on every side.</p>
<p>He was unsure where preference should abide;</p>
<p>For if the one had beauty in her face,</p>
<p>Another stood so in the people’s grace</p>
<p>For her sobriety and benignity,</p>
<p>That in folk’s report most worth had she;</p>
<p>And others were rich, but had a bad name.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, between earnest and game,</p>
<p>He, in the end, had fixed his mind on one,</p>
<p>And every other from his heart was gone,</p>
<p>And he chose her, on his own authority;</p>
<p>For love is blind always, and cannot see.</p>
<p>And when at night he his bed had sought,</p>
<p>He portrayed her in his heart and thought,</p>
<p>Her fresh beauty, and her age so tender,</p>
<p>Her little waist, her arms long and slender,</p>
<p>Her wise discipline, and her gentleness,</p>
<p>Her womanly bearing and her soberness.</p>
<p>And when to look on her he condescended,</p>
<p>He thought his choice could never be amended.</p>
<p>For when all this he concluded had,</p>
<p>He thought every other man’s wits so bad,</p>
<p>It would be for them an impossibility</p>
<p>To contest his choice; that was his fantasy.</p>
<p>His friends he sent to on the instant,</p>
<p>And begged them to honour his intent</p>
<p>Asking them swiftly to him now to come;</p>
<p>He would abridge their labour, all and some.</p>
<p>There was no further need for them to ride;</p>
<p>He’d decided where his choice would abide.</p>
<p>Placebo came, his friends were all there soon,</p>
<p>And first of all he begged of them a boon,</p>
<p>That none should any ill contention make</p>
<p>Against the decision that he chose to take;</p>
<p>Which decision was pleasant to God, said he,</p>
<p>And the very grounds of his prosperity.</p>
<p>He said there was a maiden in the town,</p>
<p>Who for her beauty had won great renown,</p>
<p>Although it chanced she was of low degree,</p>
<p>It sufficed for him she had youth and beauty;</p>
<p>Which maid, he said, he would take to wife,</p>
<p>And lead in ease and holiness his life,</p>
<p>And thanked God that he would have her all,</p>
<p>And no man should share his bliss at all,</p>
<p>And begged them to pander to his need,</p>
<p>And make sure that his courtship succeed,</p>
<p>For then, he said, his mind would be at ease.</p>
<p>‘There is,’ quoth he, ‘nothing to displease,</p>
<p>Except one thing pricking in my conscience,</p>
<p>The which I will rehearse in your presence.</p>
<p>I have,’ quoth he, ‘heard said, a year ago,</p>
<p>No man can have perfect bliss, in both –</p>
<p>That is to say, in earth and then in heaven.</p>
<p>For though he keep him from the sins seven,</p>
<p>And from every branch, too, of that tree,</p>
<p>Yet is there such perfect felicity</p>
<p>And such great ease and joy in marriage,</p>
<p>That ever I am aghast now, at my age,</p>
<p>That I may lead now so merry a life,</p>
<p>Luxurious, and free of woe and strife,</p>
<p>That I shall have my heaven on earth here.</p>
<p>And yet since heaven indeed is bought so dear,</p>
<p>With tribulation and with mighty penance,</p>
<p>How should I then, living a life so pleasant,</p>
<p>As all married men do with their wives,</p>
<p>Come to bliss where Christ eternal thrives?</p>
<p>This is my dread; and you my brethren, say,</p>
<p>You two, how to resolve this question, pray.’</p>
<p>Justinus, who hated all such folly,</p>
<p>Answered at once, in silent mockery;</p>
<p>And as he would a longer tale abridge,</p>
<p>He would no clear authority allege,</p>
<p>But said: ‘Sire, if there’s no obstacle</p>
<p>Other than this, God, by a miracle</p>
<p>And of his mercy, may for you so work.</p>
<p>That ere you have the rites of holy church</p>
<p>You may repent of the married man’s life,</p>
<p>In which you say there is no woe or strife.</p>
<p>And God forbid He do ought but send</p>
<p>The married man the grace to repent</p>
<p>Much more often than the single man!</p>
<p>And therefore, sire, the best advice I can</p>
<p>Give you, despair not, but keep in memory</p>
<p>That she perhaps may prove your purgatory.</p>
<p>She may be God’s means, and God’s whip;</p>
<p>Then shall your soul up to Heaven skip</p>
<p>Swifter than does the arrow from the bow.</p>
<p>I hope to God hereafter you may know</p>
<p>That there is none so great a felicity</p>
<p>In marriage, nor nevermore shall be,</p>
<p>That could deprive you of your salvation,</p>
<p>Provided you use, with skill and reason,</p>
<p>The pleasures of your wife, temperately,</p>
<p>And that you please her not too amorously,</p>
<p>And that you keep from every other sin.</p>
<p>My advice is done, for my wits are thin.</p>
<p>Be not aghast at it all, my brother dear,</p>
<p>And let us turn from this matter here.</p>
<p>The Wife of Bath, if you can understand</p>
<p>Her view of the business we’ve on hand,</p>
<p>Has declared it clearly in little space.</p>
<p>Farwell now; God have you in His grace.’</p>
<p>And with that Justinus and his brother</p>
<p>Took their leave, and each one of the other.</p>
<p>For when they saw that it needs must be,</p>
<p>They so wrought, by wise and cunning treaty,</p>
<p>That this maiden, named fair May, she might</p>
<p>As swiftly as ever should appear right, </p>
<p>Be wedded to this old man January.</p>
<p>I think too long you’d need to tarry,</p>
<p>If I told you of every deed and bond</p>
<p>By which she was endowed with his land,</p>
<p>Or to detail all her rich array.</p>
<p>But finally we reach the wedding day</p>
<p>And to the church both of them now went</p>
<p>There to receive the holy sacrament.</p>
<p>Forth the priest, with stole about his neck, there,</p>
<p>And bade her be like Sarah and Rebecca,</p>
<p>In wisdom and in the truth of marriage,</p>
<p>And said the orisons, in common usage,</p>
<p>Signed them with the cross, and bade God bless,</p>
<p>And made all sure enough with holiness.</p>
<p>Thus were they wedded with solemnity,</p>
<p>And down to the feast sit he and she,</p>
<p>With other worthy folk on the dais.</p>
<p>All full of joy and bliss is the place,</p>
<p>And full of instruments, and plenty,</p>
<p>The most delicious food in all Italy.</p>
<p>Before them stood instruments whose sound</p>
<p>Was such that Orpheus, nor Amphion</p>
<p>Ever made such a perfect melody.</p>
<p>With every course there came loud minstrelsy</p>
<p>That never trumpet blared with Joab near,</p>
<p>Nor Thiodomas, never was half so clear,</p>
<p>At Thebes when the city was in doubt.</p>
<p>Bacchus himself poured wine all about,</p>
<p>And Venus smiled sweetly at the sight,</p>
<p>For January had become her knight,</p>
<p>And now would test out all his courage</p>
<p>As he had done in liberty, in marriage,</p>
<p>And with her firebrand in her hand about,</p>
<p>Danced before the bride and all the rout.</p>
<p>And for sure, I dare in truth say this:</p>
<p>Hymen that the god of marriage is,</p>
<p>Never saw so merry a married man.</p>
<p>Hold your peace, now, poet Marcian,</p>
<p>Who describes that same wedding merry</p>
<p>Of Philology the bride, to Mercury,</p>
<p>And then writes the songs the Muses sung!</p>
<p>Too shallow your pen, too weak your tongue,</p>
<p>To tell the story of this marriage.</p>
<p>When tender youth is wed to stooping age,</p>
<p>There is such mirth it can’t be written.</p>
<p>Try it yourself, and you’ll be bitten,</p>
<p>Tell me if I lie, in this matter here.</p>
<p>May sat: her looks were so benign and clear,</p>
<p>To see her was to see the world of faery.</p>
<p>Queen Esther never looked so meekly</p>
<p>On Ahasuerus, never such eye had she.</p>
<p>I may not tell you of all her beauty;</p>
<p>But this much of her beauty tell I may,</p>
<p>That she was like the bright morn of May,</p>
<p>Filled with every beauty was her glance.</p>
<p>Old January was ravished, in a trance</p>
<p>Every time he looked upon her face.</p>
<p>But in his mind he menaced her apace</p>
<p>With how that night in his arms he’d strain</p>
<p>Her tighter than Paris Helen did constrain.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, he felt it a great pity</p>
<p>That he must offend her that night, and he</p>
<p>Thought to himself: ‘Alas, O tender creature,</p>
<p>Now would to God that you may endure</p>
<p>All my passion, so sharp and keen, again</p>
<p>I am aghast lest you shall it not sustain.</p>
<p>God forbid that I do all that I might!</p>
<p>Would God though that it were truly night,</p>
<p>And the night last for evermore, and so</p>
<p>I wish these people were about to go!’</p>
<p>And finally he set himself to labour</p>
<p>As best he could, while careful of his honour,</p>
<p>To hasten them from the meal in subtle wise.</p>
<p>The moment came when it was time to rise,</p>
<p>And after that they danced and drank, at last</p>
<p>Spices all about the house they cast,</p>
<p>And full of joy and bliss was every man –</p>
<p>All but a squire whose name was Damian,</p>
<p>Who carved for the knight full many a day.</p>
<p>He was so taken with this lady May</p>
<p>He was nigh mad with the pains of love.</p>
<p>He almost swooned and fainted where he stood,</p>
<p>So sore had Venus hurt him with her brand</p>
<p>That she bore, while she was dancing, in her hand.</p>
<p>And took himself off to bed hastily;</p>
<p>Of him no more at this time will I speak,</p>
<p>But leave him there to weep and to complain,</p>
<p>Till fresh May shall take pity on his pain.</p>
<p>O perilous fire, that in the bed-straw gathers!</p>
<p>O household foe, who his ill service proffers!</p>
<p>O treacherous servant, with false homely hue,</p>
<p>An adder in the bosom, sly, untrue!</p>
<p>God shield us all from your base acquaintance.</p>
<p>O January, drunken in the dance</p>
<p>Of marriage, see how your Damian</p>
<p>Your own squire, from birth that was your man,</p>
<p>Intends to do you now some villainy.</p>
<p>God grant that this household foe you see!</p>
<p>For in this world there’s no worse pestilence</p>
<p>Than a household foe daylong in your presence.</p>
<p>Perfected had the sun his arc diurnal;</p>
<p>No longer might the body of him sojourn,</p>
<p>All on the horizon in that latitude.</p>
<p>Night with her mantle that is dark of hue</p>
<p>Had overspread the hemisphere about,</p>
<p>At which departed all the merry rout</p>
<p>Of guests, and with thanks on every side.</p>
<p>Home to their houses merrily they ride,</p>
<p>Where they do whatever they think best,</p>
<p>And when it seems due time, take their rest.</p>
<p>Soon after that, our restless January</p>
<p>Desires his bed; he will no longer tarry.</p>
<p>He takes hippocras, and sweet wine laced</p>
<p>With spices hot, to make the spirits race,</p>
<p>And many a potion drinks he, as fine</p>
<p>As those the cursed monk Constantine,</p>
<p>Has written of in his book De Coitu;</p>
<p>He quaffed them all and nothing did eschew.</p>
<p>And to his private friends thus said he:</p>
<p>‘For God’s love, as soon as it may be,</p>
<p>Have the house cleared in courteous wise.’</p>
<p>And they did exactly as he did advise;</p>
<p>Men drank a toast, the curtains then were drawn,</p>
<p>The bride was brought abed, as still as stone;</p>
<p>And when the bed had by the priest been blessed,</p>
<p>Out of the chamber everybody pressed.</p>
<p>And January fast in his arms did take</p>
<p>His fresh May, his paradise, his mate.</p>
<p>He calms her, he kisses her full oft;</p>
<p>And with the bristles of his beard un-soft,</p>
<p>Like to dog-fish scales, and sharp as briars –</p>
<p>For he has freshly shaved as it transpires –</p>
<p>He rubs her all about her tender face,</p>
<p>And says thus: ‘Alas, my spouse, for a space</p>
<p>I must injure you, and greatly you offend,</p>
<p>Before the morning when we shall descend.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, consider this,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘There is no workman, whosoever he be,</p>
<p>That can work well, and also hurriedly.</p>
<p>This must be done at leisure, carefully.</p>
<p>It matters not now how long now we play;</p>
<p>Coupled in wedlock were we two today</p>
<p>And blessed be the yoke that we are in,</p>
<p>For in our actions we can do no sin.</p>
<p>A man can commit no sin with his wife,</p>
<p>No more than hurt himself with his own knife,</p>
<p>For we have leave to play, so says the law.’</p>
<p>Thus he laboured till daylight, as before,</p>
<p>And then he took some bread in spiced wine,</p>
<p>And upright in his bed sat so to dine,</p>
<p>And after that he sang out loud and clear,</p>
<p>And kissed his wife, and wanton did appear.</p>
<p>He was all coltish, folly in his eye,</p>
<p>And full of chatter as a pert magpie.</p>
<p>The slack of skin below his neck did shake</p>
<p>While he chanted, bawled, and song did make.</p>
<p>God knows what poor May thought in her heart,</p>
<p>When she saw him in his shirt upstart,</p>
<p>And in his night-cap, with his neck all lean;</p>
<p>She thought his dalliance not worth a bean.</p>
<p>Then said he thus: ‘My rest shall I take</p>
<p>Now day is come; I cannot keep awake.</p>
<p>And down he laid his head and slept till prime.</p>
<p>And afterward, when he thought it time,</p>
<p>Up rose January; but fresh May</p>
<p>Kept to her chamber till the fourth day,</p>
<p>As wives do, they think it for the best.</p>
<p>For every labourer must sometimes rest,</p>
<p>Or else the labour may not long endure –</p>
<p>That is to say, of any living creature,</p>
<p>Be it of fish or bird or beast or man.</p>
<p>Now will I speak of woeful Damian,</p>
<p>Who languishes for love, as you shall hear.</p>
<p>Therefore I’d speak to him in this manner:</p>
<p>I’d say: ‘O foolish Damian, alas!</p>
<p>Answer my question, in this pretty pass:</p>
<p>How shall you to your lady, fresh May,</p>
<p>Tell your woe? She will ever say you nay.</p>
<p>And if you speak she will your woe betray.</p>
<p>God be your help! That’s all that I can say.’</p>
<p>This sick-hearted Damian in Venus’ fire</p>
<p>So burned that he was dying of desire,</p>
<p>And so he chose to put his life at venture.</p>
<p>No longer could he in this wise endure;</p>
<p>But secretly a pen-case he did borrow,</p>
<p>And in a letter wrote out all his sorrow,</p>
<p>In the form of a plaint or of a lay</p>
<p>Unto his fair and fresh lady May.</p>
<p>And in a purse of silk hung it with art</p>
<p>Inside his shirt, laid against his heart.</p>
<p>The moon in two degrees, at noon, the day</p>
<p>That January wedded his fresh May,</p>
<p>Of Taurus, into Cancer now had ridden</p>
<p>So long had May in her chamber hidden,</p>
<p>As is the custom with these nobles all.</p>
<p>A bride should never eat in the hall</p>
<p>Until four days, or three at the least</p>
<p>Have passed; then she may go and feast.</p>
<p>The fourth day complete from noon to noon,</p>
<p>When the high Mass was over and done,</p>
<p>In the hall sat January and May,</p>
<p>As fresh as is the bright summer’s day.</p>
<p>And so it befell that this good man</p>
<p>Recalled his faithful squire Damian,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Saint Mary, how may this be,</p>
<p>That Damian attends not here on me?</p>
<p>Is he sick, or what else may betide?’</p>
<p>His squires, who stood there by his side,</p>
<p>Excused him on the grounds of sickness,</p>
<p>Which excluded him from any business;</p>
<p>No other cause would make him tarry.</p>
<p>‘Sorry I am for that,’ quoth January,</p>
<p>‘He is a noble squire, a gentle youth.</p>
<p>If he should die, ‘twere pity then, in truth.</p>
<p>He is as wise, as secret and discrete</p>
<p>As any of his rank whom you may meet,</p>
<p>And courteous too, willing to serve at table,</p>
<p>And to be a worthy man he is right able.</p>
<p>But after meat, as soon as ever I may,</p>
<p>I will visit him myself, and so shall May,</p>
<p>To give him all the comfort that I can.’</p>
<p>And, at his words, blessed him every man,</p>
<p>That of his nobility and his kindness</p>
<p>He would go comfort in his sickness</p>
<p>His squire, for it was a gentle deed.</p>
<p>‘Dame,’ quoth this January, ‘take good heed,</p>
<p>That after meat you, with your women all,</p>
<p>When you reach your chamber from this hall,</p>
<p>Go along and see our Damian.</p>
<p>And entertain him; he’s a gentleman.</p>
<p>And tell him I shall pay him a visit,</p>
<p>When I have rested for a little bit.</p>
<p>And speed you fast, for I will abide</p>
<p>Until you sleep soundly by my side.’</p>
<p>And with those words he began to call</p>
<p>For the squire who was marshal of his hall,</p>
<p>And told him certain things that he wished.</p>
<p>Fresh May straight made her way after this,</p>
<p>With all her women, to see Damian.</p>
<p>Down by his bed she sat, and began</p>
<p>To comfort him as well as she may.</p>
<p>Damian, saw his chance, as there he lay,</p>
<p>And secretly his purse and his petition,</p>
<p>In which he had told of his condition,</p>
<p>He put into her hand with nothing more</p>
<p>Than a sigh both wondrous deep and sore,</p>
<p>And softly, to her, right thus said he:</p>
<p>‘Mercy, and do thou not expose me,</p>
<p>For I am dead if this thing be espied!’</p>
<p>The purse she does in her bosom hide,</p>
<p>And goes her way – of that no more from me!</p>
<p>But unto January comes she finally,</p>
<p>Who on his bedside sits full soft</p>
<p>And clasps her then and kisses her full oft,</p>
<p>Then lays him down to sleep, and that anon.</p>
<p>She pretended she must needs be gone</p>
<p>Where everyone we know must go at need.</p>
<p>And when she of the note had taken heed,</p>
<p>She rent it all to pieces at the last,</p>
<p>And into the privy softly did it cast.</p>
<p>Who deliberates but fair fresh May?</p>
<p>Adown by old January she lay,</p>
<p>Who slept till his cough woke him abed.</p>
<p>Then he begged her strip herself naked;</p>
<p>He would, he said, take pleasure at a chance;</p>
<p>And said he found her clothes an encumbrance.</p>
<p>And she obeyed, whether she would or not.</p>
<p>But lest prudish folk be me with wrath,</p>
<p>How that he wrought, that I dare not tell,</p>
<p>Nor whether she thought it paradise or hell,</p>
<p>But here I leave them working in their wise,</p>
<p>Till evensong when they were due to rise.</p>
<p>Whether by destiny, or at a venture,</p>
<p>By starry influence, or merely nature,</p>
<p>Or by some configuration of aspects straight,</p>
<p>The heavens then appeared more fortunate</p>
<p>To present petitions full of Venus’ works –</p>
<p>For each thing has its time, so say the clerks –</p>
<p>To any woman to obtain her love,</p>
<p>I cannot say; but the great God above,</p>
<p>Who knows that no event is causeless,</p>
<p>Let Him judge all, for my pen will rest.</p>
<p>But true it is, that on our fresh May</p>
<p>Such was the impression made that day</p>
<p>By him, and by her pity for Damian,</p>
<p>That from her heart there is no way she can</p>
<p>Drive out the need to do him ease.</p>
<p>‘And then,’ she thought, ‘whoever it displease,</p>
<p>I care not; for I shall him assure</p>
<p>That I will love him best of any creature</p>
<p>Though but his shirt has he, at the start.’</p>
<p>Lo, pity swiftly flows in gentle heart!</p>
<p>Here may you see the generosity</p>
<p>Of woman, when she ponders carefully.</p>
<p>Some there may be, many such are known,</p>
<p>Tyrants with a heart as hard as stone,</p>
<p>That would have seen him perish in that place,</p>
<p>Rather than granting him a moment’s grace,</p>
<p>And rejoiced then in their cruel pride,</p>
<p>Careless of being thought a homicide.</p>
<p>But gentle May, filled full of pity,</p>
<p>In her own hand a letter wrote she,</p>
<p>In which she granted him her true grace.</p>
<p>There only lacked the time and place,</p>
<p>That might, to satisfy his wish, suffice;</p>
<p>For it must be just as he would devise.</p>
<p>And when she saw her chance one day,</p>
<p>To visit our Damian went May,</p>
<p>And surreptitiously the letter thrust</p>
<p>Under his pillow – read it then he must.</p>
<p>She took him by the hand and gave a squeeze,</p>
<p>So secretly that no one else could see,</p>
<p>And bade him be well; and off she went</p>
<p>To January when for her he sent.</p>
<p>Up rose Damian the next morrow;</p>
<p>All past was his sickness and his sorrow.</p>
<p>He combed his hair; groomed himself and dressed;</p>
<p>He did all that his lady might like best.</p>
<p>And then to January as meek does go</p>
<p>As ever a dog following the bow.</p>
<p>He is so pleasant to every man –</p>
<p>Being sly does all, for those who can –</p>
<p>That everyone spoke well of him, who should,</p>
<p>And fully in his lady’s grace he stood.</p>
<p>Thus I leave Damian, busy with his need,</p>
<p>And in my tale forth I will proceed.</p>
<p>Some scholars hold that felicity</p>
<p>Consists in pleasure, and certainly,</p>
<p>This noble January, with all his might,</p>
<p>In honest ways, as became a knight,</p>
<p>Set out to live most luxuriously.</p>
<p>His household, his dress, was as finely</p>
<p>Tailored to his degree as is a king’s.</p>
<p>And amongst the rest of his fine things,</p>
<p>He had a garden, walled all with stone;</p>
<p>So fair a one, I’d say, was never known.</p>
<p>For sure, I would not easily suppose</p>
<p>That he who wrote the Romance of the Rose</p>
<p>Could capture its beauty to the life;</p>
<p>Nor would Priapus himself suffice,</p>
<p>Though he is god of gardens, to tell</p>
<p>The beauty of that garden, and the well</p>
<p>That stood beneath a laurel, always green.</p>
<p>Many a time had Pluto and his Queen</p>
<p>Proserpina, and all her band of faery,</p>
<p>Sported there and made their melody</p>
<p>About the well, and danced, or so men hold.</p>
<p>This noble knight, January the old,</p>
<p>Took such delight in walking there, that he</p>
<p>Would suffer no one else to have the key</p>
<p>Save he himself; for of the small wicket</p>
<p>He bore the silver key that would unlock it,</p>
<p>Which, when he wished, he often did do.</p>
<p>And when he would pleasure his wife too,</p>
<p>In summer season, thither would he go,</p>
<p>With May his wife, so none would know.</p>
<p>And anything they had not done in bed,</p>
<p>Was done in the garden there instead.</p>
<p>And in this wise many a merry day</p>
<p>Lived this January and fresh May.</p>
<p>But worldly joy may not always endure,</p>
<p>For January, or for any other creature.</p>
<p>O sudden chance, O Fortune the unstable,</p>
<p>Like the scorpion endlessly deceitful,</p>
<p>Feigning with your head when you would sting,</p>
<p>Your tail is death, through your envenoming!</p>
<p>O fragile joy, O sweet venom’s taint!</p>
<p>O Monster that so subtly can paint</p>
<p>Your gifts with the hue of steadfastness,</p>
<p>So that you deceive both great and less!</p>
<p>Why have you January thus deceived?</p>
<p>You had him as your true friend received,</p>
<p>And now have bereft him of his sight –</p>
<p>For sorrow of which he would die tonight.</p>
<p>Alas, noble January, the worthy,</p>
<p>Amidst his pleasure and prosperity</p>
<p>Is stone blind, and that quite suddenly.</p>
<p>He weeps and he wails piteously;</p>
<p>And with it comes the fire of jealousy,</p>
<p>Lest his wife should fall into some folly,</p>
<p>That so burns his heart he would again</p>
<p>Prefer some man both her and him had slain.</p>
<p>For neither after his death nor in his life</p>
<p>Would he have her a lover or a wife,</p>
<p>But as a widow live, clothes black as fate,</p>
<p>Solitary as the dove that’s lost its mate.</p>
<p>But after a month or two had passed away,</p>
<p>His sorrow began to ease, truth to say.</p>
<p>For when he saw that nothing else could be,</p>
<p>In patience he accepted adversity;</p>
<p>Save that, indeed, he had not foregone</p>
<p>His jealousy: in that all days seemed one.  </p>
<p>Which jealousy of his was so outrageous</p>
<p>That not to the hall, or any other house,</p>
<p>Nor to any other place here below,</p>
<p>Would he suffer her to ride or go</p>
<p>Unless he had his hand on her always.</p>
<p>At which treatment often wept fresh May,</p>
<p>Who loved Damian so graciously,</p>
<p>That she must either die suddenly,</p>
<p>Or else must have him: at the worst,</p>
<p>She thought her very heart would burst!</p>
<p>And on his side, Damian was then</p>
<p>One of the most sorrowful of men,</p>
<p>That ever was, for neither night nor day,</p>
<p>Might he speak one word to his fresh May,</p>
<p>And as to his purpose no such matter,</p>
<p>For January would overhear their chatter,</p>
<p>Who had his hand upon her, as you know.</p>
<p>Yet nonetheless, by writing to and fro,</p>
<p>And secret signs, he knew what she meant,</p>
<p>And she knew too the gist of his intent.</p>
<p>O January, what would it you avail</p>
<p>Though you could see as far as a ship’s sail?</p>
<p>As well be blind, and then deceived be</p>
<p>As be deceived when the eye can see.</p>
<p>Lo, Argus, who had a hundred eyes,</p>
<p>For all that ever he could peer or pry,</p>
<p>Yet was he blind; and many more, God knows,</p>
<p>Who thought for certain that it was not so.</p>
<p>I’ll pass on, in relief, and say no more.</p>
<p>Fresh May, whom I’ve spoken of before,</p>
<p>In warm wax impressed the key, her mate</p>
<p>Old January carried, of the little gate</p>
<p>By which into his garden he oft went.</p>
<p>And Damian, who knew all her intent,</p>
<p>Forged a counterfeit, all secretly.</p>
<p>There is no more to say, but presently</p>
<p>A wonder will occur thanks to this gate,</p>
<p>That you shall hear about, if you will wait.</p>
<p>O noble Ovid, you spoke true, God knows!</p>
<p>What stratagem is there, despite its woes</p>
<p>Love will not in its own way discover?</p>
<p>In Pyramas and Thisbe see the manner:</p>
<p>Though they were strictly watched overall,</p>
<p>They made a plan, by whispering through a wall,</p>
<p>No one could have guessed their cunning ways.</p>
<p>But to our purpose now: before eight days</p>
<p>Had passed, ere the month of June, it befell,</p>
<p>January so desired – his wife did well</p>
<p>For she had egged him on – to go and play,</p>
<p>In the garden, and no one there but they,</p>
<p>That one morning unto his May said he:</p>
<p>‘Rise up, my wife, my love, my lady free!</p>
<p>Hear the turtle-dove, my sweet, my pet,</p>
<p>Winter is gone with all its cold and wet.</p>
<p>Come forth, now, with those dove’s eyes of thine!</p>
<p>How much more lovely are your breasts than wine!</p>
<p>The garden is enclosed all about;</p>
<p>Come forth my white spouse! Out of doubt,</p>
<p>You have wounded me in my heart, O wife;</p>
<p>There is no stain on you, on my life.</p>
<p>Come forth, and let us enjoy our sport;</p>
<p>I chose you for my wife, and my comfort.’</p>
<p>– Lewd words, from an ancient text, used he.</p>
<p>To Damian a signal then made she</p>
<p>That he should go before them and wait.</p>
<p>So Damian went and opened up the gate,</p>
<p>And in he slid, and that in such a manner</p>
<p>That no one saw him, or heard him, there;</p>
<p>And he sat still, under a bush, alone.</p>
<p>Old January, as blind as is a stone,</p>
<p>Holding May’s hand, and walking so,</p>
<p>Into the fresh garden he did go,</p>
<p>And clapped the wicket to, and firmly.</p>
<p>‘Now wife,’ quoth he, ‘here’s only you and me,</p>
<p>You are the creature that I best love.</p>
<p>For, by the Lord that sits in Heaven above,</p>
<p>I would rather perish by the knife,</p>
<p>Than offend you, my true dear wife!</p>
<p>For God’s sake, consider how I chose</p>
<p>You, not from covetousness, suppose,</p>
<p>But only for the love I bore to thee.</p>
<p>And though I am old and cannot see,</p>
<p>Be true to me, and I will tell you why.</p>
<p>Three things, surely, shall you win thereby:</p>
<p>First, love of Christ, and to yourself honour,</p>
<p>And all my property, of town and tower,</p>
<p>I give you – draw the deeds up, as is best,</p>
<p>We’ll sign tomorrow, ere sun goes to rest,</p>
<p>As God Himself may bring my soul to bliss!</p>
<p>I pray that first, to seal it, you me kiss.</p>
<p>And though I may be jealous, blame me not;</p>
<p>You are so deep imprinted in my thought</p>
<p>That when I consider of your beauty,</p>
<p>And then the ill-matched age of me,</p>
<p>I may not, for certain, though it kill me,</p>
<p>Bear to be out of your company</p>
<p>For love, indeed; I say without a doubt.</p>
<p>Now kiss me wife, and let us roam about.’</p>
<p>Fresh May, when she these words heard,</p>
<p>Graciously January she then answered;</p>
<p>But first and foremost she began to weep.</p>
<p>‘I have,’ quoth she, ‘a soul from sin to keep</p>
<p>As well as you, and also my own honour,</p>
<p>And of my wifehood too the tender flower.</p>
<p>Which that I entrusted to your hand,</p>
<p>When the priest to you my body bound.</p>
<p>Wherefore I will answer in this manner,</p>
<p>By your leave, I pray, my lord so dear:</p>
<p>I pray to God that never dawns the day</p>
<p>Or may I die as foul as woman may,</p>
<p>That ever I bring my kin that shame,</p>
<p>Or else so impair my own good name</p>
<p>As to be false; and if I do, alack,</p>
<p>Strip me then and put me in a sack,</p>
<p>And in the next river do me drench.</p>
<p>I am a gentlewoman and no wench!</p>
<p>Why speak you so? – But men are ever untrue,</p>
<p>And women are forever blamed by you.</p>
<p>You’ve no other way of speech, I believe,</p>
<p>But talk distrust, reproach to us, to grieve.’</p>
<p>And as she spoke, she saw where Damian,</p>
<p>Sat in the bushes, and coughing she began,</p>
<p>With her fingers, to make signs, that she</p>
<p>Wished Damian to climb into a tree</p>
<p>Which was charged with fruit, and up he went;</p>
<p>For truly he knew all of her intent,</p>
<p>And every sign she made, as I relate,</p>
<p>Better than January who was her mate,</p>
<p>For in a letter she had told him all,</p>
<p>Of this matter, and how it might befall.</p>
<p>And thus I leave him sitting in the pear-tree,</p>
<p>And January and May roaming merrily.</p>
<p>Bright was the day, and blue the firmament;</p>
<p>Phoebus his streams of gold downward sent</p>
<p>To gladden every flower with his warmness.</p>
<p>He was at that time in Gemini, I guess,</p>
<p>But little way from greatest declination</p>
<p>In Cancer which is Jupiter’s exaltation.</p>
<p>And so it befell, that bright morning-tide,</p>
<p>That in that garden on the farther side</p>
<p>Pluto, who is the King of Faery,</p>
<p>And many a lady of his company,</p>
<p>Following his wife, Queen Proserpina,</p>
<p>Whom he once ravished out of Etna,</p>
<p>While she gathered flowers in the mead –</p>
<p>In Claudian the story you may read,</p>
<p>How in his dreadful chariot he her snatched –</p>
<p>This King of Faery then adown him sat</p>
<p>Upon a bench of turf, fresh and green.</p>
<p>And right anon thus said he to his Queen:</p>
<p>‘My wife,’ quoth he, ‘no one can gainsay,</p>
<p>For experience proves it so, every day,</p>
<p>The treachery that woman shows to man.</p>
<p>Ten hundred thousand tales tell I can,</p>
<p>Recorded, of your untruth and lightness.</p>
<p>O Solomon, wise and richest in riches,</p>
<p>Full of sapience and worldly glory,</p>
<p>Your words are fit to be held in memory,</p>
<p>By every man of wit, who reason can!</p>
<p>Thus you praised the goodness of man:</p>
<p>“Among a thousand men I yet found one,</p>
<p>But among women all I found none.”</p>
<p>– So says the king who knew your wickedness.</p>
<p>And Jesus, Son of Sirach, I suggest,</p>
<p>Seldom says aught of you in reverence.</p>
<p>A wild fire and corrupting pestilence</p>
<p>Fall upon your bodies then tonight!</p>
<p>See you not how this honourable knight,</p>
<p>Because, alas, he is now blind and old,</p>
<p>His own servant shall render him cuckold?</p>
<p>Look, where he sits, the lecher in the tree!</p>
<p>Now will I grant, of my great majesty,</p>
<p>Unto this old, blind, worthy knight,</p>
<p>That he shall have again his true eyesight,</p>
<p>And when his wife would do him villainy.</p>
<p>Thus shall he know all of her harlotry,</p>
<p>Both a reproach to her, and others woe.’</p>
<p>‘You will?’ quoth Proserpine, ‘And will you so?</p>
<p>Now by my mother’s sire’s soul I swear,</p>
<p>That I shall give her sufficient answer here,</p>
<p>And every woman after, for her sake –</p>
<p>And though they be caught in their mistake,</p>
<p>With bold face their guilt they shall excuse,</p>
<p>And bear him down who would them accuse.</p>
<p>For lack of answer none of them shall die.</p>
<p>Though a man see it with his naked eye,</p>
<p>Yet shall we women outface him boldly,</p>
<p>And weep, and swear, and scold subtly,</p>
<p>So that men look as foolish as do geese.</p>
<p>What care I for your authorities?</p>
<p>I know well that this Jew, this Solomon,</p>
<p>Found fools among us women, many a one.</p>
<p>But though he discovered no good woman,</p>
<p>Yet were there found by many another man</p>
<p>Women true, and good, and virtuous.</p>
<p>Witness all those that dwell in Christ’s house:</p>
<p>With martyrdom they proved their constancy.</p>
<p>The Roman tales preserve the memory</p>
<p>Of many a true and constant wife also.</p>
<p>But sire, be not wrath though it be so,</p>
<p>Though he said he found no good woman;</p>
<p>I pray you, know the meaning of the man:</p>
<p>He meant thus, that supreme constancy</p>
<p>Belongs to God alone, not he or she.</p>
<p>Ay, for God indeed why take such a one,</p>
<p>And make so much of your Solomon?</p>
<p>What though he made a Temple, God’s House?</p>
<p>What though he were rich and glorious?</p>
<p>Thus made he a temple for the false gods!</p>
<p>What could he do that more outrageous was?</p>
<p>Oh, though you may whiten him with plaster,</p>
<p>He was a lecher still, and an idolater,</p>
<p>And in his old age he the Lord forsook.</p>
<p>And if God had not, so says the Book,</p>
<p>Spared him for his father’s sake, he would</p>
<p>Have lost his kingdom sooner than he should.</p>
<p>I set at naught all the villainy you cry</p>
<p>Of women, it’s not worth a butterfly!</p>
<p>I am a woman; and must have my say,</p>
<p>Or else I’ll swell till my heart shall break.</p>
<p>For since he has said we’re villainesses,</p>
<p>As ever I shall live to shake my tresses,</p>
<p>I shall not refrain, out of false courtesy</p>
<p>To speak him harm that does us villainy.’</p>
<p>‘Dame,’ quoth Pluto, ‘be no longer wrath;</p>
<p>I yield! But since I swore a sacred oath</p>
<p>That I would grant him his sight again,</p>
<p>My word shall stand: this I tell you plain.</p>
<p>I am a king; it is not meet I lie.’</p>
<p>‘And’ quoth she, ‘the Queen of Faery, I!</p>
<p>An answer shall she have, I’ll undertake.</p>
<p>Let us have no more words, for my sake;</p>
<p>For now I will no longer be contrary.’</p>
<p>So let us turn again to January,</p>
<p>Who in the garden still with his fair May</p>
<p>Sings more merrily than a popinjay,</p>
<p>‘You love I best, and shall, and other none.’</p>
<p>So long about the alleys is he gone</p>
<p>Till he is come again to that pear-tree</p>
<p>Where Damian is sitting merrily,</p>
<p>On high among the fresh leaves so green.</p>
<p>And then fresh May, the bright and serene,</p>
<p>Began to sigh, and said: ‘Alas, my side!</p>
<p>Now, sire,’ quoth she, ‘whatever may betide,</p>
<p>I must have one of the pears I see,</p>
<p>Or I must die; I long so utterly</p>
<p>To eat one of those small pears, so green.</p>
<p>Help, for Her love that is of Heaven Queen!</p>
<p>I tell you, sire, a woman in my plight</p>
<p>May have for fruit so great an appetite,</p>
<p>That without it she’ll go to her grave.’</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ quoth he, ‘that I have not a knave</p>
<p>To climb up, here! Alas! Alas! quoth he,</p>
<p>‘That I am blind.’ ‘No matter, sire,’ quoth she;</p>
<p>‘Yet if you’d vouchsafe, for God’s sake,</p>
<p>The pear-tree now in your arms to take –</p>
<p>For I know well how you mistrust me –</p>
<p>Then I could climb it well enough,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘If I could set my foot upon your back.’</p>
<p>‘Certainly,’ quoth he, ‘you shall not lack,</p>
<p>Had I to aid you with my own heart’s-blood.’</p>
<p>He stooped down, and on his back she stood,</p>
<p>And caught hold of a branch, and up she goes –</p>
<p>Ladies, I pray you, be not wrath, suppose</p>
<p>Me uncultured, I speak as best I can –</p>
<p>And suddenly anon, this Damian</p>
<p>Pulls up her smock, and in he’s gone.</p>
<p>And when Pluto saw this shameful wrong,</p>
<p>To January he gave again his sight,</p>
<p>And let him see as plain as ever he might.</p>
<p>And when he had his vision back again,</p>
<p>Never was man more happy, that is plain.</p>
<p>But on his wife his thought was fixed too;</p>
<p>And up to the tree he cast his eyes two,</p>
<p>And saw that Damian his wife addressed</p>
<p>In such a manner it may not be expressed,</p>
<p>Unless I were to speak discourteously.</p>
<p>He gave a roar and shouted out as loudly,</p>
<p>As a mother does if a child should die.</p>
<p>‘Out, help! Rape! Alas!’ he began to cry,</p>
<p>‘O brazen lady bold, what do you do?’</p>
<p>And she answered: ‘Sire, what troubles you?</p>
<p>Be patient and be rational of mind.</p>
<p>I’ve helped to doctor both your eyes blind;</p>
<p>On peril of my soul, without a lie,</p>
<p>I was told that for healing of the eye</p>
<p>Nothing was better: it would make you see,</p>
<p>If I struggled with a man up in a tree.</p>
<p>God knows, I did it all with good intent.’</p>
<p>‘Struggle!’ quoth he, ‘yes, and in it went!</p>
<p>God send you both a shameful death to die!</p>
<p>He had you: I saw it clearly with my eye,</p>
<p>Let me be hanged by the neck or else!’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ quoth she, ‘is my remedy false;</p>
<p>For certainly if you could truly see,</p>
<p>You would not utter these same words to me.</p>
<p>You have some vision, yet not perfect sight.’</p>
<p>‘I see,’ quoth he, ‘as well as ever I might,</p>
<p>Thanks be to God, with both my eyes so!</p>
<p>And by my troth, I think he did you though.’</p>
<p>‘You’re dazed, dazed, good sire,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘These are the thanks for curing you, I see!</p>
<p>Alas,’ quoth she, ‘that ever I proved so kind!’</p>
<p>‘Well dame,’ quoth he, ‘erase it from your mind.</p>
<p>Come down, my love, and if I may have said</p>
<p>Aught wrong, God help me, forgive instead.</p>
<p>But by my father’s soul I thought I saw</p>
<p>That Damian enjoy you, and what’s more</p>
<p>Your smock was gathered round your breast.’</p>
<p>‘You, sire,’ quoth she, ‘may think as suits you best.</p>
<p>But sire, a man that wakes out of his sleep,</p>
<p>Cannot grasp all at once the things he sees,</p>
<p>And cannot see what he looks on perfectly,</p>
<p>Until he has awakened more completely.</p>
<p>And so a man that has been blind, well he</p>
<p>May not all at once, nor clearly, see</p>
<p>When his new sight has first come again,</p>
<p>As he that has a day or two seen plain.</p>
<p>Till your sight has settled for a while,</p>
<p>Full many a sight may you still beguile.</p>
<p>Be careful, I pray, by Heaven’s King,</p>
<p>Many a man believes he sees a thing,</p>
<p>And finds it different to what it seems.</p>
<p>He who misperceives, chases dreams.’</p>
<p>– And with that she leaped down from the tree.</p>
<p>And January, who so glad as he?</p>
<p>He kissed her, embracing her full oft,</p>
<p>And her belly stroked he then full soft,</p>
<p>And to the house he lead her then, I’ll add.</p>
<p>Now good men, I pray you all be glad;</p>
<p>Thus ends here my tale of January;</p>
<p>God bless us, and his mother too, Saint Mary!</p>

<p>‘Ey, God’s mercy,’ said our Host, ‘Lo,</p>
<p>God keep me from such a wife, though!</p>
<p>See what cunning tricks and subtleties</p>
<p>These women use; ever busy as bees</p>
<p>They are, us foolish men to deceive.</p>
<p>And from the truth ever away will weave;</p>
<p>This Merchant’s tale does the proof reveal.</p>
<p>For without doubt, as true as any steel</p>
<p>I have a wife, though poor she may be.</p>
<p>But of her tongue a blabbing shrew is she;</p>
<p>And she has a heap more of vices, know.</p>
<p>But no more of that – let such things go!</p>
<p>Yet know you what? – In secret be it said –</p>
<p>I sorely rue the day that we were wed.</p>
<p>Though, if I were to reckon every vice</p>
<p>She has, it were a foolish exercise.</p>
<p>And why? Because it would reported be,</p>
<p>And told to her, by some in this company –</p>
<p>By whom, there is no need now to declare,</p>
<p>Since women know how to show such wares.</p>
<p>Also my wits suffice them not to tell you</p>
<p>All the tale; wherefore my tale is through.’</p>

<p>‘Squire, come near, if your wish it be,</p>
<p>And speak somewhat of love, for certainly</p>
<p>You know as much of it as any man.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, sire,’ quoth he, ‘but what I can</p>
<p>I will right heartily, I’ll not rebel</p>
<p>Against your wish; a tale will I tell.</p>
<p>Excuse me, if I should speak amiss.</p>
<p>My intent is good; lo, my tale is this.’</p>

<p>At Sarai, in the land of Tartary,</p>
<p>There dwelt a king who warred with Muscovy,</p>
<p>In which wars died many a mighty man.</p>
<p>This noble king was called Cambiuskan,</p>
<p>Who in his time was of such great renown</p>
<p>That there was nowhere in no region found</p>
<p>So excellent a lord in everything.</p>
<p>He lacked naught that does befit a king.</p>
<p>As to the sect in which he had been born,</p>
<p>He kept the law, to serve which he had sworn;</p>
<p>Added to this he was wise, brave and rich,</p>
<p>And merciful, and just, constantly fixed</p>
<p>On truthful speech, benign and honourable,</p>
<p>As firmly set as the centre of a circle,</p>
<p>Young, fresh and strong, he war espoused</p>
<p>As keenly as any true knight of his house.</p>
<p>A fair person he was and fortunate,</p>
<p>And ever so maintained his royal state</p>
<p>That there was nowhere such another man.</p>
<p>This noble king, this Tartar, Cambiuskan,</p>
<p>Had two sons by Elpheta his wife;</p>
<p>The eldest of the two named Algarsife,</p>
<p>The other son in turn called Cambalo.</p>
<p>A daughter had this noble king also,</p>
<p>Youngest of all; her name was Canace.</p>
<p>But to tell you of all her beauty,</p>
<p>Lies not in my tongue nor understanding.</p>
<p>I dare not undertake so great a thing;</p>
<p>My English too would prove insufficient.</p>
<p>Only a rhetorician, excellent</p>
<p>In all the frills belonging to that art,</p>
<p>Could describe her to you in every part.</p>
<p>I am none; I must speak then as I can.</p>
<p>And so befell it, when this Cambiuskan</p>
<p>Had twenty winters worn his diadem,</p>
<p>He held a feast, a custom among them,</p>
<p>To celebrate his own nativity</p>
<p>Which was proclaimed through Sarai city,</p>
<p>On the Ides of March, in the new year;</p>
<p>Phoebus the sun shone bright and clear,</p>
<p>For he was near his exaltation,</p>
<p>In Mars’ face, and in his mansion</p>
<p>In Aries, the choleric hot sign.</p>
<p>Cheerful was the weather and benign,</p>
<p>So that the birds in the sun’s gleam –</p>
<p>What with the season and the fresh green –</p>
<p>Full loudly sang out their affection.</p>
<p>Feeling they had at last won protection</p>
<p>Against the sword of winter, keen and cold.</p>
<p>This Cambiuskan, of whom I have told,</p>
<p>In royal vestments sat on his dais,</p>
<p>With diadem, full high in his palace,</p>
<p>And held his feast, so solemn and so rich</p>
<p>That in this world there was none other which</p>
<p>Could match it: and if I told of its array,</p>
<p>Then would I occupy a summer’s day;</p>
<p>Nor is there reason for me to advise</p>
<p>You of the order of the meal in any wise.</p>
<p>I’ll not list the exotic dishes, swans</p>
<p>In any number, also young herons.</p>
<p>And in that land too, so say the knights old,</p>
<p>There are meats that men as dainties hold,</p>
<p>Though in this country their worth is small.</p>
<p>There is no man who could tell them all;</p>
<p>I will not delay you now, for it is prime,</p>
<p>It would be fruitless, simply wasted time;</p>
<p>To my initial theme, then, I’ll have recourse.</p>
<p>It so befell that after the third course,</p>
<p>While the King in splendour sat, I say,</p>
<p>Listening to his minstrels sing and play</p>
<p>Before him at the table, delightfully,</p>
<p>In at the hall door, all suddenly,</p>
<p>There came a knight upon a horse of brass,</p>
<p>And in his hand a mirror, broad, of glass;</p>
<p>Upon his thumb he had a golden ring,</p>
<p>And by his side a naked sword hanging,</p>
<p>And up he rode to the King’s high board.</p>
<p>In all the hall was spoken never a word</p>
<p>For wonder at this knight; him to behold</p>
<p>Full eagerly they waited, young and old.</p>
<p> The unknown knight who came thus suddenly,</p>
<p>All armed, save for his head, full richly,</p>
<p>Saluted King and Queen and lords all,</p>
<p>In order, as were seated through the hall,</p>
<p>With such deep reverence and obeisance,</p>
<p>As much in speech as in his countenance,</p>
<p>That Gawain, with his ancient courtesy,</p>
<p>Though he were come again, out of Faery,</p>
<p>Could not have bettered him in any word.</p>
<p>And after this, before the King’s high board,</p>
<p>He in a manly voice proclaimed his message,</p>
<p>According to the manner of his language,</p>
<p>Without defect of syllable or letter.</p>
<p>And that his tale might appear the better,</p>
<p>As his words did, so did his face appear,</p>
<p>Like those who learn the art of speech here.</p>
<p>And though I cannot imitate his style,</p>
<p>Nor can I climb over so high a stile,</p>
<p>Yet say I this: as to the general intent,</p>
<p>What follows next adds up to what he meant –</p>
<p>If it be that I have it still in mind.</p>
<p>He said: ‘The King of Araby and Inde,</p>
<p>My liege lord, upon this solemn day</p>
<p>Salutes you as best he can and may,</p>
<p>And sends you, in honour of your feast,</p>
<p>By me who am ready to serve your needs,</p>
<p>This horse of brass, that easily and well</p>
<p>Can in the space of one day natural –</p>
<p>That is to say, in four and twenty hours –</p>
<p>Wherever you wish, in drought or in showers,</p>
<p>Transport your body into every place</p>
<p>Where your heart wishes you to pace,</p>
<p>Without harming you, through foul and fair.</p>
<p>Or if you choose to fly as high in air</p>
<p>As an eagle does when he seeks to soar,</p>
<p>This same steed will bear you evermore,</p>
<p>Unharmed, till you are where you think best,</p>
<p>Though you sleep on his back or rest,</p>
<p>And return again, when you twist this pin.</p>
<p>Who wrought it knew many a cunning thing;</p>
<p>Through many a starry configuration</p>
<p>He waited to perform this operation,</p>
<p>And many a seal and bond did understand.</p>
<p>This mirror, too, that I have in my hand</p>
<p>Has such a power that a man may in it see</p>
<p>When will befall any adversity</p>
<p>Unto your kingdom, and to yourself also,</p>
<p>And openly who is your friend or foe.</p>
<p>And moreover, if any lady bright</p>
<p>Has set her heart on any manner of knight,</p>
<p>If he is false, she shall his treason see –</p>
<p>His new love and all his secrecy –</p>
<p>So clearly then, that he shall nothing hide.</p>
<p>Wherefore, again, this cheerful summer-tide,</p>
<p>The mirror and the ring that you can see</p>
<p>He has sent to my lady Canace,</p>
<p>Your excellent daughter sitting here.</p>
<p>The virtue of the ring, if you will hear,</p>
<p>Is this: that if she should choose to wear</p>
<p>It on her thumb, or in her purse it bear,</p>
<p>There is no bird flying in the heavens</p>
<p>Whose tongue she’ll not understand as given,</p>
<p>And know its meaning openly and plain,</p>
<p>And answer it in its language once again;</p>
<p>And every herb that grows on its root,</p>
<p>She shall know too, and whom it will suit,</p>
<p>Although his wound be ever so deep and wide.</p>
<p>This naked sword that hangs by my side</p>
<p>Such virtue has, that whoever shall you smite,</p>
<p>Through his armour it will carve and bite,</p>
<p>Though it were thick as is a branching oak.</p>
<p>And whoever is wounded by its stroke,</p>
<p>Shall never be whole till you choose, of grace,</p>
<p>To stroke him with the flat of it in the place</p>
<p>Where he is hurt; that’s as much as to say</p>
<p>You must with the flat of the sword again</p>
<p>Stroke the wound and it will swiftly close.</p>
<p>This is the truth indeed, may all men know;</p>
<p>It will not fail while it is in your hold.’</p>
<p>And when the knight had thus his tale told,</p>
<p>He rode out of the hall and did alight.</p>
<p>His horse that glittered as the sun so bright,</p>
<p>Stood in the courtyard, still as any stone.</p>
<p>The knight to a chamber was led alone,</p>
<p>His armour off, to the table then he sat.</p>
<p>The gifts were carried, royally at that –</p>
<p>That is to say, the sword and the mirror –</p>
<p>In procession into the high tower,</p>
<p>By certain officers to this so sworn.</p>
<p>And unto Canace the ring was born</p>
<p>Solemnly, to where she sat at table.</p>
<p>But assuredly, without a touch of fable,</p>
<p>The horse of brass itself could not be moved,</p>
<p>It stands as if to earth it has been glued.</p>
<p>It cannot be stirred by any man alive</p>
<p>Though with pulley and windlass they may strive.</p>
<p>And why, then? – Because they lack the skill.</p>
<p>And therefore in that place they leave it still,</p>
<p>Until the knight shall teach them the manner</p>
<p>Of moving it, as you shall shortly hear.</p>
<p>Great was the crowd that swarmed to and fro</p>
<p>To gaze at the horse that stood there so,</p>
<p>For it was that high, and broad and long,</p>
<p>And well proportioned, so that it was strong,</p>
<p>As if it had been a steed of Lombardy;</p>
<p>And withal so quick of eye and lively</p>
<p>As if it an Apulian courser were.</p>
<p>Indeed, from its tail up to its ear,</p>
<p>Nature and art could not the horse amend</p>
<p>For the better, so all said in the end.</p>
<p>But always the greatest wonder was</p>
<p>How it could move about if it were brass.</p>
<p>It was a work of faery, so it seemed.</p>
<p>Various folk, they variously scheme,</p>
<p>As many minds as heads, yet none agrees,</p>
<p>Murmuring as does a swarm of bees,</p>
<p>And think according to their fantasy,</p>
<p>Repeating fragments of old poetry,</p>
<p>Saying it is in truth like Pegasus,</p>
<p>Who fled through the air, the winged horse;</p>
<p>Or else like the Greek horse of Sinon,</p>
<p>That brought great Troy to its destruction,</p>
<p>As they had in the oldest stories read.</p>
<p>‘My heart,’ quoth one, ‘is evermore in dread;</p>
<p>I fear some men at arms lie there within,</p>
<p>Whose intent is this city for to win.</p>
<p>It would be well if we such things could know.’</p>
<p>Another whispered to his neighbour, low,</p>
<p>And said: ‘He’s wrong: it’s rather, by my logic,</p>
<p>An apparition fashioned by some magic,</p>
<p>As tricksters conjure things, at feasts of state.’</p>
<p>Of sundry doubts they chatter, and debate</p>
<p>As the unknowing will do, commonly,</p>
<p>Regarding things fashioned far more subtly</p>
<p>Than they in their ignorance can comprehend;</p>
<p>Yet leap to the wrong conclusion in the end.</p>
<p>And some of them marvelled at the mirror,</p>
<p>That had been carried to the master tower,</p>
<p>Wondering how men things in it could see.</p>
<p>Another answered and said it might well be</p>
<p>Naturally, and by combinations</p>
<p>Of angles and skilful reflections,</p>
<p>And said that in Rome was such a one,</p>
<p>They spoke of Witelo and Alhazen,</p>
<p>And Aristotle, who all left directives</p>
<p>Concerning curious mirrors and perspectives,</p>
<p>As men know who have their works explored.</p>
<p>And other folk marvelled at the sword</p>
<p>That would pierce clear through everything,</p>
<p>And spoke of Telephus the Mysian king,</p>
<p>And of Achilles with his wondrous spear,</p>
<p>For he could wound and heal, as you may hear,</p>
<p>Just in the way that men may with this sword,</p>
<p>Of which right now heard our king and lord.</p>
<p>They spoke of clever tempering of metal,</p>
<p>And spoke of the agents to be used withal,</p>
<p>And how and when it should tempered be,</p>
<p>A thing unknown – at least it is to me.</p>
<p>Then they spoke about Canace’s ring,</p>
<p>And all conceded such a wondrous thing</p>
<p>Of ring-craft they had never heard, not one,</p>
<p>Except that Moses and King Solomon</p>
<p>Were said to have true knowledge of the art;</p>
<p>Thus said the people, gathering apart.</p>
<p>And in addition, some declared, it was</p>
<p>Marvellous to make of fern-ash glass,</p>
<p>And yet glass is unlike the ash of fern,</p>
<p>Though since this was nothing new to learn,</p>
<p>Those soon ceased their chattering and wonder.</p>
<p>Some wonder just as deeply about thunder,</p>
<p>And ebb and flood, and gossamer, and mist,</p>
<p>And other things as long as doubts exist.</p>
<p>Thus they chatter, wrangle and advise,</p>
<p>Till the King from the table deigns to rise.</p>
<p>Phoebus had left the line meridional,</p>
<p>And still ascending was the beast royal,</p>
<p>The noble Lion, and his star, Aldiran,</p>
<p>When the Tartar King, Cambiuskan,</p>
<p>Rose from the table, at which sat he.</p>
<p>Before him went the sound of minstrelsy</p>
<p>Till in the state room all men were present</p>
<p>Where sounded there diverse instruments</p>
<p>That it was heavenly for them to hear.</p>
<p>Then there danced sweet Venus’ children dear,</p>
<p>For their Lady in the Fishes sat, on high,</p>
<p>And gazed on them with a friendly eye.</p>
<p>The noble King was seated on his throne;</p>
<p>The unknown knight was fetched: he alone</p>
<p>Into the dance he goes with Canace.</p>
<p>Now is there revelling and jollity</p>
<p>That no dull man might easily devise!</p>
<p>He must have known of love in every guise,</p>
<p>And be a jovial man, as fresh as May,</p>
<p>Who could devise for you a like array.</p>
<p>For who could describe for you the dances</p>
<p>So strange in form, the fresh countenances,</p>
<p>Such secret glances and dissimulations,</p>
<p>For dread of jealous men’s observations?</p>
<p>No man but Lancelot, and he long dead.</p>
<p>Therefore I pass from all this joy, instead;</p>
<p>I say no more, but in their happiness</p>
<p>I leave them, till their supper they address.</p>
<p>The steward orders spices, by and by,</p>
<p>And also wine, the minstrelsy’s ally.</p>
<p>The ushers and the squires swiftly gone,</p>
<p>The spices and the wine arrive anon.</p>
<p>They eat and drink, and when that’s at an end,</p>
<p>Unto the temple, as is right, they wend.</p>
<p>The service done, they feasted all the day.</p>
<p>What need to tell you of all this array?</p>
<p>Each man well knows, that at a king’s feast</p>
<p>There’s plenty for the greatest and the least,</p>
<p>And more dainties than are in my knowing.</p>
<p>After the supper went the noble King</p>
<p>To see the horse of brass, with a whole rout</p>
<p>Of lords and ladies gathered round about.</p>
<p>Such marvelling was there at this horse of brass</p>
<p>That, since the great siege of Troy came to pass,</p>
<p>Where men marvelled at a horse also,</p>
<p>There was never such wonder here below.</p>
<p>But finally, the King asked the knight</p>
<p>The virtues of the courser, and its might,</p>
<p>And prayed him to explain its governance.</p>
<p>The horse soon began to frisk and dance,</p>
<p>When the knight laid hand upon its rein,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Sire, there’s no more to explain</p>
<p>But, when you wish to ride off anywhere,</p>
<p>You turn the pin inserted in its ear,</p>
<p>Which I shall tell you of, between us two.</p>
<p>You must tell him the places to which you</p>
<p>Wish to go, or the country where you’d ride.</p>
<p>And when you reach a place where you would bide,</p>
<p>Bid him descend, then turn another pin –</p>
<p>For the action of the creature lies therein –</p>
<p>And he’ll descend and execute your will.</p>
<p>And in that place he will bide, quite still;</p>
<p>Though all men to the contrary be sworn,</p>
<p>He cannot be dragged from there or drawn.</p>
<p>But if you choose to bid him hence be gone,</p>
<p>Turn the pin, and he will vanish anon</p>
<p>Out of every man and woman’s sight,</p>
<p>Yet return once more, whether by day or night,</p>
<p>When you choose to summon him again,</p>
<p>In such a manner as I will explain</p>
<p>Between us two, and that full soon. Now you,</p>
<p>May ride when you wish; there’s no more to do.’</p>
<p>Informed as the King was, by the knight,</p>
<p>When he had grasped all in his mind aright</p>
<p>Both the manner and form of the whole thing,</p>
<p>Full glad and blithe, the fine and noble King</p>
<p>Repaired to his revels as before.</p>
<p>The bridle then into the tower they bore,</p>
<p>And kept it with his jewels, prized and dear;</p>
<p>The horse then vanished – how I am not clear –</p>
<p>Out of his sight; you get no more of me!</p>
<p>But thus I leave, in joy and jollity,</p>
<p>Cambuskian, with his lords a-feasting,</p>
<p>Till well nigh the day began to spring.</p>

<p>The nourisher of our digestion, Sleep,</p>
<p>Began to wink on them, and bade them keep</p>
<p>Note that much drink and labour must have rest.</p>
<p>And with a yawning mouth all there he kissed,</p>
<p>And told them all that sleep must have its hour,</p>
<p>For the humour of blood was now in power. </p>
<p>‘Cherish your blood, Nature’s friend,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>They thanked him, yawning, by two and three,</p>
<p>And everyone began to seek their rest,</p>
<p>As sleep commanded, and all thought it best.</p>
<p>Their dreams shall not be told, or not by me;</p>
<p>Their heads were those of inebriety,</p>
<p>That fashions dreams with no significance,</p>
<p>They slept till it was prime, at a glance,</p>
<p>Or most of them – except for Canace.</p>
<p>She was quite temperate, as women be;</p>
<p>For of her father she had taken leave</p>
<p>To go and rest soon after it was eve –</p>
<p>She had no wish both pale and wan to be,</p>
<p>Nor jaded the next morn, for all to see –</p>
<p>And slept her first sleep, and then awoke.</p>
<p>For such a joy in her heart now spoke,</p>
<p>Telling of her curious ring and mirror,</p>
<p>That twenty times she had changed colour.</p>
<p>And in her sleep, due to the impression</p>
<p>The mirror made on her, she had a vision.</p>
<p>Wherefore she, ere the sun began to glide</p>
<p>Skywards, called the governess at her side,</p>
<p>And told her that she wished to rise.</p>
<p>This old woman, pleased to appear wise,</p>
<p>Being her governess, answered her anon,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Madame, shall you be gone,</p>
<p>And where this early, folk are all at rest?’</p>
<p>‘I will arise,’ quoth she, ‘I think it best</p>
<p>To sleep no longer, and to walk about.’</p>
<p>The governess summoned then a great rout</p>
<p>Of women, and up they rose, ten or twelve.</p>
<p>And up rose fresh Canace herself,</p>
<p>As rosy and bright as does the new sun</p>
<p>That of the Ram has four degrees now run –</p>
<p>No higher was he when she ready was.</p>
<p>And forth she walked on an easy course,</p>
<p>Arrayed, as for the pleasant season sweet,</p>
<p>Lightly, to play and roam with idle feet,</p>
<p>And only five or six of her company,</p>
<p>By woodland path forth through the park goes she.</p>
<p>The vapours rising from the earth abroad</p>
<p>Made the sun seem redder and full broad;</p>
<p>But nonetheless it was so fair a sight</p>
<p>That it made all their hearts soar with delight,</p>
<p>What with the new season and the morning,</p>
<p>And all the birds that she heard singing,</p>
<p>For right anon she knew what they all meant</p>
<p>By their songs, and all their true intent.</p>
<p>The nub and gist of every tale that’s told,</p>
<p>If it is hidden till desire grows cold</p>
<p>In those who’ve listened to what came before,</p>
<p>The savour passes: the longer it is the more,</p>
<p>Through an abundance of prolixity.</p>
<p>And for the same reason, it seems to me,  </p>
<p>I should to the nub and gist now descend,</p>
<p>And make of her walking soon an end.</p>
<p>Upon a tree, from drought as white as chalk,</p>
<p>Where Canace was idling on her walk,</p>
<p>There sat a falcon, over her head full high,</p>
<p>That with a piteous voice began to cry</p>
<p>Till all the wood resounded far and deep.</p>
<p>She had beaten herself so piteously</p>
<p>With both her wings, that the crimson blood</p>
<p>Ran crown to root of the tree on which she stood.</p>
<p>And ever and again she uttered cry and shriek,</p>
<p>And pricked and stabbed herself so with her beak</p>
<p>That there is never a tiger or cruel beast</p>
<p>That dwells in wood or forest deep at least,</p>
<p>That would not have wept, if weep it could,</p>
<p>For pity of her, shrieking where she stood.</p>
<p>For there was never yet a man alive –</p>
<p>If only I could the falcon well describe –</p>
<p>Who has heard of another of such fairness,</p>
<p>Both in her plumage and her nobleness</p>
<p>Of shape, and all things that might valued be.</p>
<p>A peregrine falcon she appeared to be,</p>
<p>From foreign lands; and ever, as she stood,</p>
<p>She swooned now and again for loss of blood,</p>
<p>Till she had well nigh fallen from the tree.</p>
<p>The King’s fair daughter, Canace,</p>
<p>Who on her finger wore the curious ring</p>
<p>By which she comprehended everything</p>
<p>That any bird might in its language say,</p>
<p>And could give answer in the selfsame way,</p>
<p>Understood now what the falcon said,</p>
<p>And for pity of it was good as dead.</p>
<p>And to the tree she hastened rapidly,</p>
<p>And at the falcon gazed all mercifully,</p>
<p>And held her skirt out wide, for she knew</p>
<p>The falcon must fall from the branch too</p>
<p>When it next swooned, from the lack of blood.</p>
<p>A long while waiting there she stood,</p>
<p>Till at last she spoke in this manner here,</p>
<p>To the hawk, as you shall swiftly hear:</p>
<p>‘What is the reason, if you’re free to tell,</p>
<p>That you so feel the furious pains of Hell?’</p>
<p>Quoth Canace to the hawk high above.</p>
<p>‘Is it for sorrow at death or loss of love?</p>
<p> - For I think those the causes two below</p>
<p>That most may cause a noble heart woe.</p>
<p>Of other kinds of harm I need not speak,</p>
<p>For you yourself upon yourself harm wreak,</p>
<p>Which proves that it is either ire or dread</p>
<p>Provides the reason why you cried and bled,</p>
<p>Since I can see no other who does you chase.</p>
<p>For love of God, toward yourself show grace,</p>
<p>Or say how I may help? – For west or east</p>
<p>I never saw before now bird or beast</p>
<p>That behaved towards itself so piteously.</p>
<p>You slay me with your sorrow, verily,</p>
<p>I possess for you such great compassion.</p>
<p>For God’s love, from the tree now come,</p>
<p>And as I am here a king’s daughter true,</p>
<p>If that I in truth all the reason knew</p>
<p>For your distress, if it lay in my might,</p>
<p>I would ease it, before the fall of night,</p>
<p>So help me the great God of kin and kind!</p>
<p>And herbs I shall in plenty for you find,</p>
<p>To heal all your hurts, and that right swiftly.’</p>
<p>Then the falcon shrieked more piteously</p>
<p>Than before, and fell to the ground anon,</p>
<p>And lay in a swoon, dead and like a stone,</p>
<p>Till into her lap did Canace her take,</p>
<p>And she began from the swoon to wake.</p>
<p>And when that she out of her swoon awoke,</p>
<p>Then in her hawk’s language thus she spoke:</p>
<p>‘That pity flows readily in gentle heart,</p>
<p>Feeling its likeness in another’s smart,</p>
<p>Is proved every day, as men may see,</p>
<p>As well by practice as authority,</p>
<p>For gentle heart reveals its gentleness.</p>
<p>I see indeed, you show for my distress</p>
<p>Compassion, now, my fair Canace,</p>
<p>Out of true womanly benignity</p>
<p>Nature in your character has set there.</p>
<p>And not in any hope my fate to better,</p>
<p>But replying to your generosity,</p>
<p>And so that others may be warned by me,</p>
<p>As by the puppy’s punishment the lion,</p>
<p>For that reason and to that conclusion,</p>
<p>While I have opportunity and space,</p>
<p>I will confess my hurt, as I die apace.’</p>
<p>And all the while the one her sorrow told,</p>
<p>The other wept, as if turned to water cold,</p>
<p>Until the falcon bade her to be still;</p>
<p>And with a sigh thus she spoke her will.</p>
<p>‘Where I was bred – alas, that bitter day! –</p>
<p>And fostered on a rock of marble grey,</p>
<p>So tenderly that nothing troubled me,</p>
<p>I never knew a day’s adversity</p>
<p>Till I could fly high beneath the sky.</p>
<p>There dwelt a male falcon close nearby,</p>
<p>Who seemed the well of all gentleness.</p>
<p>Yet was he full of treason and falseness,</p>
<p>That was cloaked so by a humble manner</p>
<p>And the hue of truth, beneath the banner</p>
<p>Of pleasantries, and his taking every pain,</p>
<p>That no one would have known how he could feign,</p>
<p>So deeply ingrained appeared his colours.</p>
<p>Just as a serpent lurks beneath the flowers</p>
<p>And waits the time its evil to commit,</p>
<p>Just so this God of Love’s hypocrite</p>
<p>Did so with ceremony and obeisance,</p>
<p>Kept up appearances with due observance,</p>
<p>Consistent with the courtesies of love.</p>
<p>As in a tomb all seems fair above,</p>
<p>While beneath it is the corpse, as you know,</p>
<p>Such was this hypocrite, both hot and cold.</p>
<p>And in this way pursued he his intent,</p>
<p>That, save the fiend, none knew what he meant,</p>
<p>Till he so long had wept and complained,</p>
<p>And many a year his service to me feigned,</p>
<p>Until my heart, too merciful and foolish,</p>
<p>All innocent then of his crowned malice,</p>
<p>Fearful of his death, as it seemed to me,</p>
<p>Given his oaths, and from false security,</p>
<p>Granted him its love, on this condition:</p>
<p>That evermore my honour and renown</p>
<p>Be guaranteed, privately and apart.</p>
<p>That is to say, I gave him all my heart</p>
<p>According to his deserts, and all my thought –</p>
<p>God knew, and he, otherwise I would not –</p>
<p>Took his heart in exchange for mine, I say.</p>
<p>But truth it is, and has been many a day,</p>
<p>A true man and a thief think not as one.</p>
<p>And when he saw that things so travelled on</p>
<p>That I had fully granted him my love,</p>
<p>In such manner as I have said above,</p>
<p>And given him my true heart as free</p>
<p>As he swore he had given his to me,</p>
<p>Anon this tiger, full of deceitfulness,</p>
<p>Fell on his knees, in devout humbleness,</p>
<p>With such deep reverence, seemed there</p>
<p>So like a noble lover in his manner,</p>
<p>So ravished, it appeared then, by joy</p>
<p>That neither Jason nor Paris at Troy –</p>
<p>Jason, I say? For sure, no other man</p>
<p>Since Lamech, he who at first began</p>
<p>To love two women, as was said of yore –</p>
<p>No never, since the first man was born,</p>
<p>Could man contrive the twenty thousandth part</p>
<p>Of the false sophistry of all his art,</p>
<p>None were worthy to lace his shoe,</p>
<p>When false duplicity was there to do,</p>
<p>Nor one who could pay thanks as he to me!</p>
<p>His manners were so heavenly to see</p>
<p>To any woman: were she ever so wise;</p>
<p>So painted he and polished to the eye</p>
<p>His speech as fine as was his countenance.</p>
<p>And I so loved him then for his obeisance,</p>
<p>And for the truth I thought was in his heart,</p>
<p>If there was anything that caused him smart,</p>
<p>However slight it was, I could ne’er resist</p>
<p>The pain, and felt how death my heart did twist.</p>
<p>And briefly, so far now this matter went,</p>
<p>That my will was his will’s instrument;</p>
<p>That is to say, my will obeyed his will</p>
<p>In everything that was also reasonable,</p>
<p>Keeping the limits of my honour ever,</p>
<p>Never was anyone so dear, none dearer,</p>
<p>Than he to me, none shall be so, God knows.</p>
<p>This lasted longer than a year or so,</p>
<p>With I believing of him naught but good.</p>
<p>Yet finally, so at the last it stood,</p>
<p>That Fortune herself no longer wished him</p>
<p>To dwell in the same location I was in.</p>
<p>Whether I felt woe, is not in question;</p>
<p>I cannot give you any true description,</p>
<p>But one thing I’ll say boldly, I</p>
<p>Know what the pain of death is thereby.</p>
<p>Such pain I felt, so deeply did I grieve.</p>
<p>Thus on that day of me he took his leave,</p>
<p>So sorrowfully too, I thought verily</p>
<p>That he had felt the hurt as deep as me,</p>
<p>When I heard him speak, saw his pale hue.</p>
<p>For despite all, I thought that he was true,</p>
<p>And also thought that he’d return again</p>
<p>Within a little while, I should explain –</p>
<p>And there were reasons why he had to go</p>
<p>Matters of honour: it often happens so –</p>
<p>So I made virtue of necessity,</p>
<p>And took it well, since thus it had to be.</p>
<p>As I best might, I hid from him my sorrow,</p>
<p>And took his hand, Saint John keep all us so,</p>
<p>And said to him thus: “Lo, I am yours, in all.</p>
<p>Be such as I have been to you, evermore.”</p>
<p>What he replied, I need not now rehearse.</p>
<p>Who spoke better than him? Who acted worse?</p>
<p>After he’d spoken well, came evil soon!</p>
<p>Therefore is she in need of a long spoon,</p>
<p>Who sups with the devil; so I’ve heard say.</p>
<p>Well, in the end he set forth on his way,</p>
<p>And forth he fled, till where it pleased him best</p>
<p>He chose a place, and there he took his rest.</p>
<p>I think he must have had this text in mind,</p>
<p>That “everything according to its own kind</p>
<p>Takes its delight” – thus men say: I guess,</p>
<p>Men by their nature love new-fangledness,</p>
<p>As a bird does that in a cage they feed;</p>
<p>For though night and day they give him heed</p>
<p>Strew his cage as fair and soft as silk,</p>
<p>And give him sugar, honey, bread, and milk,</p>
<p>Yet, on the instant that his door is up,</p>
<p>He with his feet will kick away the cup,</p>
<p>And to the wood he’ll fly and worms eat.</p>
<p>So newfangled are they in their meat,</p>
<p>Novelty love, by nature and by kind;</p>
<p>No nobleness of blood has power to bind.</p>
<p>Such was this tierce, this falcon, woe the day!</p>
<p>Though he was gentle born, and fresh, I say,</p>
<p>And goodly for to see, humble and free,</p>
<p>He saw one day a kite all swiftly flee,</p>
<p>And all at once he loved this kite so</p>
<p>That all his love from me did swiftly go,</p>
<p>And thus he broke his word in that wise.</p>
<p>Now has the kite my love before her eyes,</p>
<p>And I am lost, and there’s no remedy!’</p>
<p>And the falcon cried at that with misery,</p>
<p>And swooned away next on Canace’s arm.</p>
<p>Great was the sorrow at the hawk’s harm,</p>
<p>That Canace and all her women betrayed.</p>
<p>They knew not how the falcon might be saved;</p>
<p>But Canace bore her homeward in her lap,</p>
<p>And softly in bandages then did her wrap,</p>
<p>Wherever she with her beak had hurt herself.</p>
<p>Now Canace must seek for herbs and delve</p>
<p>Them out of the ground, and make salves new</p>
<p>Of herbs both potent and of finest hue</p>
<p>To heal the hawk; to and fro day and night</p>
<p>She works the business and with all her might.</p>
<p>And by her bed-head she wrought a mew,</p>
<p>To house the hawk, covered with velvet blue,</p>
<p>The colour of constancy in women seen.</p>
<p>And all without the mew was painted green,</p>
<p>In which were pictured all the false fowls,</p>
<p>Such as the titmice are, tierces and owls,</p>
<p>And magpies, to screech at them and chide,</p>
<p>Out of spite were painted alongside.</p>
<p>So I leave Canace her hawk nursing.</p>
<p>I will say no more now about her ring</p>
<p>Till it should serve my purpose to explain</p>
<p>How the falcon claimed her love again</p>
<p>Repentant, for the story tells us so,</p>
<p>Through the good offices of Cambalo,</p>
<p>The King’s son of whom I have you told.</p>
<p>But henceforth I will my tale unfold,</p>
<p>By speaking of adventures and of battles,</p>
<p>Of which were never heard greater marvels.</p>
<p>First will I tell you of Cambiuskan,</p>
<p>Who in his day many a city won;</p>
<p>And afterwards I’ll speak of Algarsife,</p>
<p>And how he won Theodora to wife,</p>
<p>For whom he often in great peril was,</p>
<p>For which he sought help of the horse of brass;</p>
<p>And after will I speak of Cambalo,</p>
<p>Who in the lists, her two brothers’ foe,</p>
<p>Fought for Canace, ere he might her win.</p>
<p>And where I left off, I’ll again begin.</p>

<p>Apollo whirled his chariot up so high,</p>
<p>Into the god’s house, Mercury the sly –</p>

<p>‘In faith, Squire, well you did yourself acquit</p>
<p>And right nobly too; I applaud your wit,’</p>
<p>Quoth the Franklin, ‘considering your youth,</p>
<p>Feelingly you spoke, sire, all praise to you!</p>
<p>In my opinion, not a one that’s here</p>
<p>Can match your eloquence, or be your peer,</p>
<p>While you’re alive; God give you now good chance,</p>
<p>And of your powers send you continuance,</p>
<p>In your speech I took great pleasure, truly.</p>
<p>I have a son, and by the Trinity,</p>
<p>Rather than have twenty pounds in land,</p>
<p>Though right now it came into my hand,</p>
<p>I’d have him be a man of such discretion</p>
<p>As you are. Fie, then, on mere possession,</p>
<p>If a man be but virtuous withal!</p>
<p>I my son have chided, and shall do more,</p>
<p>For he to virtue’s word will ne’er attend,</p>
<p>All he can do is play at dice, and spend,</p>
<p>Lose all that he has, through such ill usage.</p>
<p>And he’d rather talk with some lowly page</p>
<p>Than commune with a true gentle knight,</p>
<p>From whom he might learn gentleness aright.’</p>
<p>‘That, for your gentleness!’ quoth our Host.</p>
<p>‘What, Franklin! Pardee, sire, well you know</p>
<p>That every one of you must tell the rest</p>
<p>A tale or two, or deny my sworn request.’</p>
<p>‘That know I well, sire,’ quoth the Franklin,</p>
<p>‘I pray you, hold me not in your disdain,</p>
<p>Though to the Squire I spoke a word or two.’</p>
<p>‘Tell on your tale, let’s have no more ado!’</p>
<p>‘Gladly, sir Host,’ quoth he, ‘I will obey</p>
<p>Your every wish; now hark to what I say.</p>
<p>I will be contrary to you in no wise,</p>
<p>As far as my humble wit may suffice.</p>
<p>I pray to God that it may please you, too;</p>
<p>Then will I know that it is good, and true.</p>

<p>The noble Breton lords, in olden days,</p>
<p>From various adventures, fashioned lays,</p>
<p>Rhymed them in the earliest Breton tongue,</p>
<p>Which lays to their instruments were sung,</p>
<p>Or else were read to them for their pleasure;</p>
<p>And one I do recall, in some measure,</p>
<p>Which I’ll relate as well as ever I can.</p>
<p>But sirs, since I’m an unlearned man,</p>
<p>At the beginning first I do beseech</p>
<p>That you excuse my unpolished speech.</p>
<p>I never learned rhetoric, that’s for certain;</p>
<p>And whatever I speak is bare and plain.</p>
<p>I never slept awhile on Mount Parnassus,</p>
<p>Nor studied Cicero, that’s Marcus Tullius.</p>
<p>Adornments I have none, ah, true indeed,</p>
<p>Only such colours as adorn the mead,</p>
<p>Or else such as are used to dye and paint.</p>
<p>Rhetoric’s hues to me are dull and quaint</p>
<p>My spirit knows little of them, I fear.</p>
<p>But if you listen, you my tale shall hear.</p>

<p>In Armorica, now called Brittany,</p>
<p>There was a knight that loved, and truly he</p>
<p>Strove to serve his lady in best wise.</p>
<p>And many a labour, many an enterprise</p>
<p>He for his lady wrought ere she was won;</p>
<p>For she was among the fairest under the sun,</p>
<p>And also she came of such a high kindred</p>
<p>That the knight scarcely dared, for dread</p>
<p>To tell her of his woe, pain, and distress.</p>
<p>But at the last, seeing his worthiness,</p>
<p>And especially his humble obeisance,</p>
<p>She took such pity on his true penance</p>
<p>That privately they entered in accord,</p>
<p>She to make him her husband and her lord,</p>
<p>With such lordship as men have over wives.</p>
<p>And to live in greater bliss all their lives,</p>
<p>Of his free will he swore to her as knight</p>
<p>That never in all his life, day or night,</p>
<p>Would he take upon himself the mastery</p>
<p>Against her will, nor show her jealousy,</p>
<p>But obey her, and follow her will in all,</p>
<p>As any lover in his lady’s thrall;</p>
<p>Save that the name alone of sovereignty</p>
<p>Should he have, lest it shame his dignity.</p>
<p>She thanked him, and with full great humbleness</p>
<p>She said: ‘Sire, since, of your gentleness,</p>
<p>You’ll allow me to have so great a rein,</p>
<p>May God grant that never between us twain,</p>
<p>Through guilt of mine, be any war or strife.</p>
<p>Sire, I will be your humble loyal wife;</p>
<p>Or may my heart break first, such is my pledge.</p>
<p>Thus were they both in quiet and at rest.</p>
<p>For one thing, goods sirs, I may safely say,</p>
<p>That lovers must one another fast obey,</p>
<p>If they’d keep company for many a day.</p>
<p>Love will not be constrained by mastery;</p>
<p>When mastery comes, the God of Love anon</p>
<p>Beats his wings, and farewell, he is gone!</p>
<p>Love is a thing as any spirit free.</p>
<p>Women, by nature, wish for liberty,</p>
<p>And not to be constrained, as in thrall,</p>
<p>And so do men, and truth is this for all.</p>
<p>Look who is most patient in their love,</p>
<p>Has the advantage and so towers above.</p>
<p>Patience is a high virtue, that’s certain,</p>
<p>For it achieves, as clerics do maintain,</p>
<p>Things that force is unable to attain.</p>
<p>At every word we must not chide, complain;</p>
<p>Learn to accept, or else, for here below,</p>
<p>You shall learn, whether you will or no.</p>
<p>And in this world, indeed, no one exists</p>
<p>Who does not sometimes speak a word amiss.</p>
<p>Ire, sickness, or the stars’ configuration,</p>
<p>Wine, woe, or our humours’ alteration</p>
<p>Often gives cause to do amiss or speak.</p>
<p>Revenge for every wrong may no man wreak;</p>
<p>According to the time, act with temperance</p>
<p>All you that understand good governance.</p>
<p>And therefore had this wise and noble knight,</p>
<p>Sworn patience, so as to live at ease, aright,</p>
<p>And she to him as earnestly did swear</p>
<p>That he should never find a fault in her.</p>
<p>Here may men see a humble, wise accord!</p>
<p>Thus she makes him her servant and her lord –</p>
<p>Servant in love, and yet her lord in marriage;</p>
<p>Thus was he both in lordship and in bondage.</p>
<p>Bondage? – Nay, in lordship high above,</p>
<p>Since he had both his lady and his love;</p>
<p>His lady, certain, and his wife also,</p>
<p>Which the law of love accords with, though.</p>
<p>And now he had met with such prosperity,</p>
<p>Home with his wife he went to his country,</p>
<p>Not far from Penmarch Point, his dwelling was,</p>
<p>Where he lived in bliss and in solace.</p>
<p>Who can know, unless he wedded be,</p>
<p>The joy, the ease, and the prosperity</p>
<p>That is between a husband and a wife?</p>
<p>A year and more lasted this blissful life,</p>
<p>Till the knight whose story I discuss,</p>
<p>Of Caer-rhud, and called Arveragus,</p>
<p>Determined to go and live a year or twain,</p>
<p>In England, that was also called Britain,</p>
<p>To seek in arms both worship and honour,</p>
<p>For all his pleasure won he from such labour,</p>
<p>And dwelt there two years; the book says thus.</p>
<p>Now I’ll cease to speak of Arveragus,</p>
<p>And I will speak of Dorigen his wife,</p>
<p>That loved her husband as her heart’s life.</p>
<p>At his absence she wept sore and sighed,</p>
<p>As does when she will the noblest bride.</p>
<p>She mourned, waked, wailed, fasted, cried;</p>
<p>While longing for his presence thus denied,</p>
<p>So that all this wide world she set at naught.</p>
<p>Her friends, who knew the burden of her thought,</p>
<p>Comforted her, when they could, in every way.</p>
<p>They preached at her, telling her night and day,</p>
<p>That she was killing herself, in vain, alas!</p>
<p>And every comfort possible that was</p>
<p>Useful they gave, made it all their business,</p>
<p>To try and put and end to her heaviness.</p>
<p>By a slow process, known to everyone,</p>
<p>Men may carve away so long in stone</p>
<p>That some figure may thus imprinted be.</p>
<p>So long had they comforted her that she</p>
<p>Received, through hope and through reason,</p>
<p>The imprint of their endless consolation,</p>
<p>And they began her sorrow to assuage;</p>
<p>She must not always let her feelings rage.</p>
<p>And Arveragus, amongst all this care,</p>
<p>Had sent letters, speaking of his welfare,</p>
<p>And how he would return swiftly again;</p>
<p>Else this sorrow would her heart have slain.</p>
<p>Her friends saw her sorrow start to abate,</p>
<p>And begged her on their knees, for God’s sake,</p>
<p>To come and roam about in company,</p>
<p>To drive away her gloomy fantasy.</p>
<p>And finally she granted their request,</p>
<p>Because she saw that it was for the best.</p>
<p>Now, her castle stood close by the sea,</p>
<p>And often with her friends wandered she,</p>
<p>To take her pleasure, on a bank full high,</p>
<p>Where she saw many a ship and barge go by,</p>
<p>Sailing their course, wherever they chanced to go.</p>
<p>But that too was a portion of her woe,</p>
<p>For to herself, full oft, ‘Alas!’ said she,</p>
<p>‘Is there no ship, of all these that I see,</p>
<p>Will bring me my lord again? Then my heart</p>
<p>Would be cured of bitter sorrow’s smart.’</p>
<p>At other times she would sit and think,</p>
<p>And cast her eyes downward from the brink.</p>
<p>Yet when she saw the ghastly rocks all black,</p>
<p>For fear indeed her heart would almost crack,</p>
<p>On her feet she could scarce herself maintain.</p>
<p>Then would she sit upon the grass again,</p>
<p>And piteously the flowing tide behold,</p>
<p>And speak as thus, with sorrowful sighs cold:</p>
<p>‘Eternal God that through your providence</p>
<p>Lead the world in certain governance,</p>
<p>You made nothing in vain and yet, alack,</p>
<p>Lord, these fiendish, grisly rocks all black,</p>
<p>That seem to me rather a foul confusion</p>
<p>In their work, than any fair creation</p>
<p>Of such a wise and perfect God, thus able,</p>
<p>Why have you wrought this work unreasonable?</p>
<p>For by this work, south, north, west or east</p>
<p>There is nurtured neither man nor beast.</p>
<p>It does no good, to my mind, but annoys.</p>
<p>See you not, Lord, how mankind it destroys?</p>
<p>A hundred thousand souls, among mankind</p>
<p>These rocks have slain, no more brought to mind;</p>
<p>Yet mankind’s so fair a portion of your work</p>
<p>You made it in your image, says the clerk.</p>
<p>Thus it seems you had both love and charity</p>
<p>Towards mankind; so how then may it be</p>
<p>That you created such means to destroy?</p>
<p> – Which do no good, but evermore annoy.</p>
<p>I know, indeed, that clerics will attest,</p>
<p>To arguments, that show all’s for the best,</p>
<p>Though what the reasons are I do not know.</p>
<p>But may the God that made the winds to blow</p>
<p>Keep safe my lord! – That is my conclusion.</p>
<p>To clerks I leave all the disputation.</p>
<p>But would to God that all these rocks so black</p>
<p>Were sunken into Hell, and came not back,</p>
<p>For his sake, they slay my heart with fear!’</p>
<p>– Thus she did say, with many a piteous tear.</p>
<p>Her friends could see she derived no sport</p>
<p>Roaming by the sea, but pure discomfort,</p>
<p>And chose to take their pleasure somewhere else.</p>
<p>They led her among rivers, and by wells,</p>
<p>And through other places all delightful;</p>
<p>Danced, played chess, backgammon, to be helpful.</p>
<p>So one day, right in the morning-tide,</p>
<p>Unto a garden that was there beside,</p>
<p>Into which had been taken as they planned</p>
<p>Victuals and other things at their command,</p>
<p>They went to sport and play the livelong day.</p>
<p>And this was on the sixth morn in May,</p>
<p>When May had painted with his softest showers</p>
<p>The garden, filled with leaves and with flowers;</p>
<p>And man’s handicraft so skilfully</p>
<p>Arrayed had all this garden, truthfully,</p>
<p>That never was there a garden so prized,</p>
<p>Unless it were the ancient Paradise.</p>
<p>The odour of flowers and the fresh sight</p>
<p>Would have rendered any heart light</p>
<p>That ever was born, unless some great sickness</p>
<p>Or great sorrow consumed it with distress,</p>
<p>So full it was of beauty and elegance.</p>
<p>And after dinner they began to dance</p>
<p>And sing as well, save Dorigen alone,</p>
<p>Who ever made plaint, and ever made moan,</p>
<p>For in the dance she saw not him below,</p>
<p>Who was her husband and her love also.</p>
<p>But nonetheless she must a while abide,</p>
<p>Be of good hope, and let her sorrow slide.</p>
<p>Now in this dance, among the other men,</p>
<p>There pranced a squire before Dorigen,</p>
<p>Who fresher was and jollier in array,</p>
<p>As I do live, than is the month of May.</p>
<p>He sang and danced better than any man,</p>
<p>That is, or was, since ever the world began.</p>
<p>And then he was, if I should him describe,</p>
<p>One of the handsomest of men alive;</p>
<p>Young, strong, right virtuous, and rich and wise,</p>
<p>And well beloved, considered a great prize.</p>
<p>And briefly, truth to tell, as I recall,</p>
<p>Unbeknown to Dorigen at all,</p>
<p>This gallant squire, a servant true of Venus,</p>
<p>Who by name was called Aurelius,</p>
<p>Had loved her the best of any creature,</p>
<p>As was his fate, for two years and more,</p>
<p>But never dared proclaim his suffering;</p>
<p>He drank his sorrow straight from the spring.</p>
<p>He had despaired; nothing he dared say,</p>
<p>Save in his songs something he’d convey</p>
<p>Of all his woe, while generally lamenting.</p>
<p>He said he loved, but was beloved by nothing.</p>
<p>Of such matter he made many lays,</p>
<p>Songs, plaints, rondeaux and virelais,</p>
<p>How that he dare not of his sorrow tell,</p>
<p>But languished as a Fury does in Hell;</p>
<p>And die he must, he said, as did Echo,</p>
<p>For Narcissus, who dared not tell her woe.</p>
<p>In no other manner than this, as I say,</p>
<p>Dare he to her his woe at all betray;</p>
<p>Save that, perhaps, sometimes at a dance,</p>
<p>Where the young folk will keep observance,</p>
<p>It may well be he looked upon her face</p>
<p>In such a manner as man asks for grace,</p>
<p>Though she knew nothing of his intent.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it chanced, ere they went thence,</p>
<p>Because he happened to be her neighbour,</p>
<p>And was a man of good repute and honour,</p>
<p>And she had known him some time before,</p>
<p>They fell to talking, and more and more</p>
<p>Towards his purpose drew Aurelius.</p>
<p>And when he saw his chance, he spoke up thus:</p>
<p>‘Madame,’ quoth he, ‘by God who this world made,</p>
<p>If I had known your heart felt no dismay,</p>
<p>I wish that day when your Arveragus</p>
<p>Crossed the sea, that I, Aurelius,</p>
<p>Had gone too, never to return again.</p>
<p>For I see now my service is but vain;</p>
<p>My reward is but the breaking of my heart.</p>
<p>Madame, have pity on my bitter smart,</p>
<p>For with a word you may me slay or save.</p>
<p>Here at your feet, would God, they dug my grave!</p>
<p>I have no time to say what I would say;</p>
<p>Have mercy, sweet, or death is mine today.’</p>

<p>She began to stare at Aurelius.</p>
<p>‘Is that your thought,’ quoth she, ‘and say you thus?</p>
<p>Never have I suspected what you meant.</p>
<p>But now, Aurelius, knowing your intent,</p>
<p>By that God who gave me soul and life,</p>
<p>Know, I shall never play the faithless wife</p>
<p>In word or deed, as far as I have wit;</p>
<p>I will be his to whom I have been knit.</p>
<p>Take that for a final answer now from me.’</p>
<p>But after it teasingly thus said she:</p>
<p>‘Aurelius, by the high God above,</p>
<p>As I wish I might have been your love,</p>
<p>Since I hear you so piteously complain.</p>
<p>Lo, that day when from Brittany’s main,</p>
<p>You remove every reef, stone by stone,</p>
<p>So no ship is hampered through that zone –</p>
<p>I say, when the coast is rendered so clean</p>
<p>Of rocks, that never a stone can be seen –</p>
<p>Then I will love you more than any man.</p>
<p>Hear my truth said, as plainly as I can.’</p>
<p>‘Is there no better grace in you?’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘No, by the Lord,’ quoth she, ‘who fashioned me,</p>
<p>For I know full well it shall never betide.</p>
<p>Let such folly out of your heart slide!</p>
<p>What pleasure is added thus to a man’s life</p>
<p>In making love to another man’s wife,</p>
<p>Who can have her body when he will?</p>
<p>Aurelius was ever in deeps sighs still;</p>
<p>Woe was Aurelieus, when this he heard,</p>
<p>And with sorrowful heart he answered her:</p>
<p>‘Madame, to lose you is impossible!</p>
<p>So let death come, sudden and horrible.’</p>
<p>– And with that he turned away anon.</p>
<p>Her other friends appeared, many a one,</p>
<p>And in the alleyways roamed up and down,</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of this sad conclusion.</p>
<p>And suddenly the revels began anew,</p>
<p>Till the bright sun had lost his yellow hue,</p>
<p>Since the horizon robbed them of his light –</p>
<p>Which is as much as to say, that it was night.</p>
<p>And home they went, in joy and in solace,</p>
<p>Save only poor Aurelius, alas!</p>
<p>He to his house has gone, with sorrowful heart.</p>
<p>That he and death shall not be long apart,</p>
<p>He feels, and senses his heart grow cold.</p>
<p>Up to the heavens he his hands does hold,</p>
<p>On his bare knees then he sets him down,</p>
<p>And in a rage of feeling says his orison.</p>
<p>For woe his wits were addled in his head;</p>
<p>He knew not what he spoke, but thus he said.</p>
<p>With piteous heart his plaint was thus begun</p>
<p>Unto the gods, and first unto the sun.</p>
<p>‘Apollo,’ said he, ‘God and governor</p>
<p>Of every plant, and herb, tree and flower,</p>
<p>Who gives, according to your declination,</p>
<p>To each of them its time and season,</p>
<p>As your position changes, low or high,</p>
<p>Lord Phoebus, cast now your merciful eye</p>
<p>On sad Aurelius, wretched and forlorn!</p>
<p>Lo, Lord, my lady now my death has sworn</p>
<p>Though I am guiltless, your benignity</p>
<p>Upon my doomed heart may yet take pity.</p>
<p>For I know, Lord Phoebus, if you wished,</p>
<p>You, save for my lady, could help me best.</p>
<p>Now vouchsafe me that I might advise</p>
<p>You how I may be helped, and in what wise.</p>
<p>Luna, your sister blest, who bright does sheen,</p>
<p>And of the sea is chief goddess and queen,</p>
<p>(Though Neptune has the mastery of the sea,</p>
<p>Yet empress high above him still is she),</p>
<p>You know, Lord, that just as her desire</p>
<p>Is to be quickened, lighted from your fire,</p>
<p>And thus she follows you diligently,</p>
<p>So does the sea desire, naturally,</p>
<p>To follow her, since she is the goddess</p>
<p>Of both the sea and rivers, great and less.</p>
<p>Wherefore, Lord Phoebus, this is my request –</p>
<p>Perform this miracle, or my heart may burst –</p>
<p>That even now at your next opposition,</p>
<p>When you are in the sign of the Lion,</p>
<p>Beg that she so great a flood will bring</p>
<p>That five fathom at the least it may spring</p>
<p>Higher than the highest rock in Brittany,</p>
<p>And for two years let this great flood be.</p>
<p>Then, surely, to my lady I may say,</p>
<p>“Hold to your pledge; the rocks are all away.”</p>
<p>‘Lord Phoebus, do this miracle for me:</p>
<p>Ask her to run her course no more swiftly</p>
<p>Than you, I say, request that your sister go</p>
<p>No faster than you, these two years though.</p>
<p>Then she will be at full the entire way,</p>
<p>And the spring flood last both night and day.</p>
<p>And if she’ll not vouchsafe in that manner,</p>
<p>To grant to me my sovereign lady dear,</p>
<p>Beg her to sink each rock deeper down</p>
<p>Into her own dark region underground</p>
<p>The shadowy kingdom Pluto dwells in,</p>
<p>Or nevermore shall I my lady win.</p>
<p>Your temple at Delphi I’ll barefoot seek,</p>
<p>Lord Phoebus, see the tears run down my cheek,</p>
<p>And on my pain have some compassion!’</p>
<p>And with that he swooned after a fashion,</p>
<p>And lay on the ground a long time in a trance.</p>
<p>His brother, who knew of this mischance,</p>
<p>Caught him up, and to bed had him brought.</p>
<p>Despairing, filled with his tormented thought,</p>
<p>I’ll leave this sorrowing creature there to lie;</p>
<p>Let him choose whether he’ll live or die!</p>
<p>Arvegarus, in health, with great honour,</p>
<p>Like one who was of chivalry the flower,</p>
<p>Is home again, with other noblemen.</p>
<p>O joyous are you now, sweet Dorigen,</p>
<p>Who have your gallant husband in your arms,</p>
<p>The fresh knight, the worthy man at arms,</p>
<p>Who loves you as he loves his own heart’s life!</p>
<p>Nothing made him suspect that to his wife</p>
<p>Any man had spoken, while he voyaged about,</p>
<p>Of love indeed, nor was he plagued with doubt.</p>
<p>He gave not a thought to any such matter,</p>
<p>But danced, jousted, and made much of her.</p>
<p>And so in joy and bliss I’ll let him dwell,</p>
<p>And of the ill Aurelius I will tell.</p>
<p>Languishing, and in torment furious,</p>
<p>Two years and more lay sad Aurelius,</p>
<p>Before the ground he dare set foot upon.</p>
<p>Of comfort all this time he had none,</p>
<p>Save from his brother, who was a clerk.</p>
<p>He knew of all this woe and all this work;</p>
<p>For to no other creature, it is certain,</p>
<p>Dare he a single word of this explain,</p>
<p>In his breast bore it discretely rather,</p>
<p>More so than Pamphilus for Galatea.</p>
<p>His breast was whole, as outwardly was seen,</p>
<p>But in his heart was ever the arrow keen;</p>
<p>And a wound unhealed, with surface scar,</p>
<p>In surgery is perilous of cure</p>
<p>Unless they touch the arrow, or come thereby.</p>
<p>His brother wept, away from public eye,</p>
<p>Till finally he fell into remembrance</p>
<p>That while he was at Orleans in France –</p>
<p>As students who are young and zealous</p>
<p>To read in arts abstruse and curious</p>
<p>Seek every nook and cranny, in turn,</p>
<p>The recondite sciences for to learn –</p>
<p>He recalled that once, upon a day,</p>
<p>In the college, at Orleans, as I say,</p>
<p>A book of natural magic, he saw</p>
<p>Because his friend a bachelor of law,</p>
<p>Though he was there for other study,</p>
<p>Left it lying, on his desk, discretely.</p>
<p>Which book spoke fully of the operations</p>
<p>Touching the eight and twenty mansions</p>
<p>Belonging to the moon, and suchlike folly,</p>
<p>Considered, in our day, not worth a flea;</p>
<p>For Holy Church’s faith, to our belief</p>
<p>Allows no like illusion to bring grief.</p>
<p>And when this book entered his remembrance,</p>
<p>Swiftly his heart for joy began to dance,</p>
<p>And to himself he said thus, privately:</p>
<p>‘My brother will be cured right swiftly;</p>
<p>For I am certain there are true sciences</p>
<p>By which men conjure up appearances,</p>
<p>Such as the subtlest conjurors display.</p>
<p>For often at feasts, have I heard men say,</p>
<p>Conjurors within a hall, full large,</p>
<p>Have filled a space with water and a barge,</p>
<p>And in the hall have rowed up and down.</p>
<p>Sometimes a grim lion have they shown,</p>
<p>And sometimes flowers sprang up instead,</p>
<p>Sometimes a vine with grapes white and red,</p>
<p>Sometimes a castle, all of lime and stone,</p>
<p>And when they chose, they banished it, anon;</p>
<p>Or so it seemed, to everyone in sight.</p>
<p>‘Now then, I deduce, that if I might</p>
<p>At Orleans some old learned fellow find</p>
<p>Who has the lunar mansions in his mind</p>
<p>Or other natural magic, as above,</p>
<p>He could ensure my brother had his love.</p>
<p>For by illusions a learned man, in fact,</p>
<p>Could make men think that all the rocks black</p>
<p>Of Brittany had vanished every one,</p>
<p>And ships along the shore might go and come,</p>
<p>And then maintain the sight a week or so,</p>
<p>So may my brother be cured of his woe;</p>
<p>Then she must keep to all her promises,</p>
<p>Or bring shame on herself, I’d suggest.’</p>
<p>Why must I make a longer tale of this?</p>
<p>To his brother’s bed he came, and all his</p>
<p>Comfort brought, urging him to be gone</p>
<p>To Orleans, that he started up anon,</p>
<p>And forward on the road did he fare,</p>
<p>Hoping to be eased of all his care.</p>
<p>When they had almost come to that city,</p>
<p>Only two furlongs short, or maybe three,</p>
<p>A young clerk, roaming by himself, they met,</p>
<p>Who greeted them in Latin, at the outset,</p>
<p>With great politeness, and this wondrous thing:</p>
<p>‘I know,’ quoth he,’ the reason for your coming</p>
<p>And before a foot more they onward went,</p>
<p>He told them all about their true intent.</p>
<p>Our Breton scholar asks him then to say</p>
<p>What has become of scholars of past days,</p>
<p>Whom he once knew: dead as it appears,</p>
<p>At which he weeps a plethora of tears.</p>
<p>Down from his horse Aurelius got, anon,</p>
<p>And with the magician forth was gone</p>
<p>Home to his house: he set them at their ease.</p>
<p>They lacked no refreshment that could please;</p>
<p>So well provisioned a house as was this one</p>
<p>Aurelius in all his life had seen none.</p>
<p>Conjured for him, ere they went to supper,</p>
<p>Were forests, parks, filled with wild deer;</p>
<p>Where he saw stags with antlers high,</p>
<p>The largest ever seen by human eye.</p>
<p>He saw a hundred of them slain by hounds,</p>
<p>Some, shot by arrows, bled from bitter wounds.</p>
<p>And when they had all vanished, these wild deer,</p>
<p>Came falconers beside a river fair,</p>
<p>Who with their hawks had many heron slain.</p>
<p>Then he saw knights jousting on a plain;</p>
<p>And after this in conjured elegance,</p>
<p>He saw his lady there as she did dance,</p>
<p>And he himself was dancing, as he thought.</p>
<p>And when the master who this magic wrought</p>
<p>Saw it was time, he clapped his hands, and lo,</p>
<p>Farewell all our revel, it vanished so!</p>
<p>And yet they had not moved from the house,</p>
<p>While viewing all this sight so marvellous,</p>
<p>But in his study, with his books, the three</p>
<p>Of them sat still, and no one else to see.</p>
<p>His squire then was summoned by the master,</p>
<p>Who said to him: ‘Is all prepared for supper?</p>
<p>Almost an hour it is, and no mistake,</p>
<p>Since I bade you our supper swiftly make,</p>
<p>While these worthy men I took with me</p>
<p>Into the study, to view my library.’</p>
<p>‘Sire’ quoth the squire, ‘I’ll make a vow</p>
<p>That it is ready, you may eat right now.’</p>
<p>‘Let us go sup, then, ‘quoth he, ‘that is best.</p>
<p>Amorous people too must sometimes rest!’</p>
<p>After the supper they bargained freely</p>
<p>As to what sum the master’s prize should be</p>
<p>For removing all the rocks from Brittany,</p>
<p>From Gironde too, to the Seine’s estuary.</p>
<p>He showed reluctance, swore, for God’s sake,</p>
<p>Less than a thousand pounds he would not take,</p>
<p>Certainly, for that sum he would have none.</p>
<p>Aurelius with blissful heart anon</p>
<p>Answered thus: ‘Fie on your thousand pound!</p>
<p>This wide world of ours, men say is round,</p>
<p>I would give that, if I were lord of it!</p>
<p>The bargain’s made, take what you think fit;</p>
<p>You shall be paid, truly, on my oath.</p>
<p>But look you now, no negligence or sloth</p>
<p>Must keep us here longer than tomorrow.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the scholar, ‘on my faith, I vow.’</p>
<p>Aurelius went to bed, as he thought best,</p>
<p>And well nigh all that night he took his rest.</p>
<p>Tired with his labour, yet with hopes of bliss,</p>
<p>Ease to his woeful heart came not amiss.</p>
<p>On the morrow, as soon as it was day,</p>
<p>To Brittany they rode the nearest way,</p>
<p>Aurelius, with the scholar at his side,</p>
<p>And descended, where they would abide.</p>
<p>It was, then, say the books, as I remember,</p>
<p>The cold and frosty season, in December.</p>
<p>Phoebus waxed old, and in this station</p>
<p>Dull brass was he, who in high declination</p>
<p>Shines like burnished gold with rays so bright;</p>
<p>But now in Capricorn he shed his light,</p>
<p>Where full pale he shone, I dare maintain.</p>
<p>The bitter frosts, with winter’s sleet and rain,</p>
<p>All the garden greenery had interred.</p>
<p>Janus sat by the fire with double beard,</p>
<p>And from his bugle-horn he supped his wine,</p>
<p>Before him brawn of the sharp-tusked swine,</p>
<p>And ‘Sing, Noel!’ cried every lusty man.</p>
<p>Aurelius, doing all that ever a man can</p>
<p>Gave the master good cheer and reverence,</p>
<p>And prayed him to employ his diligence</p>
<p>To release him from his pain’s fierce smart,</p>
<p>Or plunge a sword into his very heart.</p>
<p>The subtle clerk took pity on the man</p>
<p>And night and day as swiftly as one can</p>
<p>Sought out a time to achieve conclusion,</p>
<p>That is to say create the right illusion</p>
<p>By deft appearance, conjuror’s mystery –</p>
<p>I lack the terms for such astrology –</p>
<p>That she and everyone would think and say</p>
<p>That from Brittany the rocks were all away,</p>
<p>Or else had been sunken underground.</p>
<p>So, at last, the proper date was found</p>
<p>To try his tricks and work the wretchedness</p>
<p>Of all such superstitious cursedness.</p>
<p>His Toledan tables forth he brought,</p>
<p>Rightly corrected, so he lacked for naught,</p>
<p>Neither for blocks nor individual years,</p>
<p>Nor to fix the root, lacked nothing here</p>
<p>For his equations of centre, argument,</p>
<p>And the proportionals convenient</p>
<p>For the calculation of everything:</p>
<p>So, from the stars’ eighth sphere, in his working,</p>
<p>How far the moon’s first mansion had moved</p>
<p>From the first point of Aries above,</p>
<p>That in the ninth sphere considered is;</p>
<p>Full subtly he calculated this.</p>
<p>When he had located the first mansion,</p>
<p>He knew all the rest by due proportion,</p>
<p>And in which sign the moon rose he knew well</p>
<p>And in which face and term, and so could tell</p>
<p>Which was now the moon’s precise mansion,</p>
<p>As a result of all this operation:</p>
<p>And he knew the right observances,</p>
<p>To create such illusions and mischances</p>
<p>As heathen folk employed in olden days.</p>
<p>After which there were no more delays,</p>
<p>And through his magic, for two weeks I’d say,</p>
<p>It seemed that all the rocks were cleared away.</p>
<p>Aurelius, still in despair through all of this,</p>
<p>As to whether he’d have his love or fare amiss,</p>
<p>Waited night and day to see this miracle.</p>
<p>And when he knew there was no obstacle –</p>
<p>And that the rocks had vanished every one –</p>
<p>Down at the master’s feet he fell anon,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I, woeful wretch, Aurelius,</p>
<p>Thank you, lord, and my lady Venus,</p>
<p>Who have freed me from my cares cold!’</p>
<p>And to the temple then away did go,</p>
<p>To where he knew he should his lady see.</p>
<p>And when he saw his opportunity,</p>
<p>With fearful heart, full humbly did appear,</p>
<p>And greeted then his sovereign lady dear.</p>
<p>‘My true lady,’ quoth this woeful man,</p>
<p>‘Whom I most dread and love, deep as I can,</p>
<p>Whom I would in this world least displease,</p>
<p>Had I not suffered for you such miseries</p>
<p>That I must die here at your feet anon,</p>
<p>I’d not have shown that I was woebegone.</p>
<p>But surely I must die, or still complain;</p>
<p>You slay me, guiltless, merely from the pain.</p>
<p>But though to sorrow for my death you’re loath,</p>
<p>Think a while before you break your oath.</p>
<p>Repent you so, and think of God above,</p>
<p>Before you punish me who seek your love.</p>
<p>For, Madame, now recall the pledge I cite –</p>
<p>Though I may claim nothing of you by right</p>
<p>My sovereign lady, but only ask your grace –</p>
<p>Yet in the garden, yonder, in that place,</p>
<p>You well know what you have sworn to me,</p>
<p>And there your troth you plighted loyally</p>
<p>To love me best – God’s witness, you said so,</p>
<p>Albeit that I am unworthy though.</p>
<p>Madame, your honour I speak for, I vow,</p>
<p>More than to save my heart’s life right now:</p>
<p>I have done all that you commanded me,</p>
<p>And if you deign to, you may go and see.</p>
<p>Do as you will; yet have your oath in mind,</p>
<p>For quick or dead, there you shall me find.</p>
<p>With you it lies, to save my life or slay;</p>
<p>But true it is the rocks are now away.’</p>
<p>He took his leave, and she astonished stood.</p>
<p>In her whole face was not a drop of blood.</p>
<p>She had thought never to fall into this trap.</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ quoth she, ‘to suffer this mishap!</p>
<p>I thought it an impossibility</p>
<p>That such a monstrous miracle could be!</p>
<p>It defies the processes of nature.’</p>
<p>And home she went, a sorrowful creature;</p>
<p>For fear, indeed, she could scarcely move.</p>
<p>She wept, she wailed there, for a day or two,</p>
<p>And swooned so, that it was sad to see.</p>
<p>But why she did so, not a soul told she,</p>
<p>For far from town was her Arveragus.</p>
<p>Yet to herself she spoke, lamenting thus,</p>
<p>With pallid face, and sorrowful did appear</p>
<p>In her lament, as you may truly hear.</p>
<p>‘Alas, Fortune, of you I will complain,</p>
<p>Who suddenly have snared me in your chain,</p>
<p>To escape from which I find no succour,</p>
<p>Save only death, or else yet dishonour;</p>
<p>One of these two I must clearly choose.</p>
<p>Yet, nonetheless, I had much rather lose</p>
<p>My life, than see my body suffer shame,</p>
<p>Or know myself as false, and lose my name.</p>
<p>And by my death I may be quit of this.</p>
<p>Has not many a noble wife, and foolish</p>
<p>Maiden, slain herself before now, alas,</p>
<p>Rather than bring her body to that pass?</p>
<p>Yes, for certain; lo, these tales bear witness.</p>
<p>When thirty tyrants full of wickedness</p>
<p>Had Phidon slain, in Athens at a feast,</p>
<p>They ordered his daughters to be seized</p>
<p>And brought before them, humbled in their sight,</p>
<p>All naked, to assuage their foul delight,</p>
<p>And in their father’s blood they made them dance</p>
<p>Upon the pavement – God send them mischance!</p>
<p>For which these woeful maidens, full of dread,</p>
<p>Rather than they should lose their maidenheads,</p>
<p>Broke away, and leapt into a well,</p>
<p>And drowned themselves, as the old books tell.</p>
<p>The Messenians requested that men seek</p>
<p>In Lacadaemon, fifty maidens meek,</p>
<p>On whom they might work their lechery.</p>
<p>But there was none of all that company</p>
<p>That did not slay herself, with good intent,</p>
<p>Choosing to die rather than to assent</p>
<p>And be robbed there of their maidenhead.</p>
<p>Why then of death should I remain in dread?</p>
<p>Lo, then, the tyrant, Aristoclides,</p>
<p>Who loved a maiden called Stimphalides,</p>
<p>Who when her father slain was in the night,</p>
<p>Unto Diana’s temple fled outright,</p>
<p>And grasped hold of her statue too,</p>
<p>From which statue she could not be loosed.</p>
<p>No one there could tear her hands away,</p>
<p>Till in that selfsame place, they did her slay.</p>
<p>Since these maidens died before they might</p>
<p>Be defiled by man’s foul appetite,</p>
<p>A wife should rather kill herself than be</p>
<p>Defiled by any man, it seems to me.</p>
<p>What shall I say of Hasdrubal’s fair wife</p>
<p>Who at Carthage deprived herself of life?</p>
<p>For when she knew the Romans had the town,</p>
<p>She took her children all, and so leapt down</p>
<p>Into the fire, and chose to perish there</p>
<p>Rather than any Roman ravage her.</p>
<p>Did not Lucrece slay herself, alas,</p>
<p>At Rome when she oppressed was</p>
<p>By Tarquin, because she thought it shame</p>
<p>To be alive when she had lost her name?</p>
<p>Of Miletus, the seven maids also</p>
<p>Slew themselves indeed, for dread and woe,</p>
<p>Rather than let the Gauls them oppress.</p>
<p>More than a thousand stories, I should guess,</p>
<p>Might I now tell about the matter here.</p>
<p>When Abradatas fell, his wife so dear</p>
<p>Slew herself, and let her life-blood glide</p>
<p>Into Abradatas’ wounds both deep and wide,</p>
<p>And said: “My body, at the least, I say,</p>
<p>No man shall defile, for I go my way.”</p>
<p>What need of more examples, to explain</p>
<p>How so many women themselves have slain</p>
<p>Rather than be defiled, in misery?</p>
<p>I conclude that better it is for me</p>
<p>To slay myself than be defiled thus.</p>
<p>I will be true to my Arveragus,</p>
<p>Or I will slay myself in some way here,</p>
<p>As did Demotion’s daughter dear,</p>
<p>Because she would not defiled be.</p>
<p>O Scedasus, the heart fills with pity</p>
<p>Reading how your daughter died, alas,</p>
<p>Who slew herself in a similar pass.</p>
<p>As great a pity was felt, or even more,</p>
<p>For the Theban maid who foiled Nicanor</p>
<p>And slew herself, a case of equal woe.</p>
<p>Another Theban maiden died also,</p>
<p>Because a Macedonian her oppressed;</p>
<p>Her death repaid her loss of maidenhead.</p>
<p>What shall I say of Niceratus’ wife,</p>
<p>Who in like case bereft herself of life?</p>
<p>How true also to Alcibiades,</p>
<p>His lover was, who chose to die, as these,</p>
<p>Rather than let his body unburied be?</p>
<p>Lo what a wife Alcestis was!’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘What says Homer of good Penelope?</p>
<p>All Greece knew her wifely chastity.</p>
<p>Of Laodamia is it written thus,</p>
<p>That when at Troy died Protesilaus,</p>
<p>She would no longer live beyond his day.</p>
<p>The same of noble Portia, I may say:</p>
<p>Without Brutus, she too could not live,</p>
<p>For his was all the heart she had to give.</p>
<p>The perfect wife was Artemisia,</p>
<p>Honoured in Barbary by every peer.</p>
<p>O, Teuta, queen, your wifely chastity</p>
<p>To every wife may as a mirror be!</p>
<p>The same thing I may say of Bilia,</p>
<p>Of Rhodogue, and of Valeria.’</p>
<p>So Dorigen, a day or two, did sigh,</p>
<p>Ever purposing that she would die.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, on the third night,</p>
<p>Home came Avergarus, the noble knight,</p>
<p>And asked her why she wept so sore;</p>
<p>At which she began to weep even more.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth she, ‘that ever I was born!</p>
<p>Thus have I said,’ quoth she, ‘thus have I sworn’ –</p>
<p>And told him all that you have heard before;</p>
<p>No need to repeat it here for you once more.</p>
<p>Her husband, with kind face, in friendly wise,</p>
<p>Answered, and said as I shall now advise:</p>
<p>‘Is there aught else, Dorigen, but this?’</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ quoth she, ‘God help me, as it is,</p>
<p>It is too much, were it God’s own will!’</p>
<p>‘Yet, wife,’ quoth he, ‘let sleep on what is still.</p>
<p>All may be well, perchance, even today.</p>
<p>You must keep your promise, by my faith!</p>
<p>For, and may God have mercy upon me,</p>
<p>I would rather be slain, mercilessly,</p>
<p>For the very love I have for you, I say,</p>
<p>Than that your word you not keep always.</p>
<p>His word is the noblest thing a man may keep.’</p>
<p>– Yet with these words he began to weep,</p>
<p>And said, ‘I forbid you, on pain of death,</p>
<p>Ever, while left to you are life and breath,</p>
<p>To tell a single soul of this adventure.</p>
<p>As I best may, this woe I will endure;</p>
<p>And show you no countenance of heaviness,</p>
<p>Lest folk may think harm of you, or guess.’</p>
<p>He summoned forth a squire and a maid;</p>
<p>‘Go forth anon, with Dorigen’ he said,</p>
<p>‘And bring her to the place she tells, anon.’</p>
<p>They took their leave and on their way were gone,</p>
<p>But they knew not why she thither went;</p>
<p>He told no one at all of his intent.</p>
<p>Perchance a heap of you, a crowd that is,</p>
<p>Consider him a foolish man in this,</p>
<p>Seeking to place his wife in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Hear the tale, then you may judge her truly;</p>
<p>She may have better fortune than it seems;</p>
<p>Judge when you know whether the tale redeems.</p>
<p>That squire, you will remember, Aurelius,</p>
<p>He, who to Dorigen had proved so amorous,</p>
<p>Happened by chance our Dorigen to meet,</p>
<p>In the town, and right in the busiest street,</p>

<p>As she was about to take the road, outright,</p>
<p>To the garden where her troth she did plight.</p>
<p>And he was walking garden-ward also,</p>
<p>For he spied on her wherever she may go</p>
<p>From her house to any manner of place.</p>
<p>So thus they met, by chance or yet by grace,</p>
<p>And he saluted her with glad intent,</p>
<p>And asked her then whitherward she went.</p>
<p>And she answered, as though she were half-mad,</p>
<p>‘Unto the garden as my husband bade,</p>
<p>To keep my word to you, alas, alas!’</p>
<p>Aurelius, stunned at what had come to pass,</p>
<p>Felt, in his heart, a true compassion</p>
<p>For her, and the cause of her lamentation,</p>
<p>And for Arveragus, the worthy knight,</p>
<p>Who bade her keep her word, come what might,</p>
<p>So loath was he to let her stray from the truth.</p>
<p>And in his heart such pity filled the youth,</p>
<p>He thought, considering it from every side,</p>
<p>That he should rather let intention slide,</p>
<p>Than commit such churlish wretchedness</p>
<p>Against generosity and gentleness.</p>
<p>So, briefly, in a few words, he said thus:</p>
<p>‘Madame, say to your lord Arveragus,</p>
<p>That since I perceived his great nobleness,</p>
<p>His treatment of you, in your great distress,</p>
<p>That he would rather be ashamed – sad truth –</p>
<p>Than let you break your word to me, forsooth,</p>
<p>Then I would rather suffer lasting woe</p>
<p>Than ever harm the love between you so.</p>
<p>I release, you, Madame, from your bond,</p>
<p>Quit of every promise, out of hand,</p>
<p>That you have made to me heretofore,</p>
<p>As free as on the day when you were born.</p>
<p>My troth I plight, that I shall never grieve</p>
<p>You for promise given; and take my leave</p>
<p>Of you, the best and the truest wife</p>
<p>That ever I have known in all my life.</p>
<p>Now wives beware of oaths and, for the rest,</p>
<p>Remember Dorigen, let me suggest!</p>
<p>Thus may a squire do a gentle deed</p>
<p>As well as any knight, as you can see.’</p>
<p>She thanked him then, on her knees all bare,</p>
<p>And home to her husband she did fare,</p>
<p>And told him everything you’ve heard said.</p>
<p>You may be sure, he more joy displayed</p>
<p>Than it were possible for me to write.</p>
<p>What more of this story should I cite?</p>
<p>Arveragus and Dorigen his wife</p>
<p>In sovereign bliss lived out their life.</p>
<p>With never any anger there between;</p>
<p>He cherished her as if she were a queen,</p>
<p>And she was true to him for evermore.</p>
<p>Of these two folk, now, you’ll hear no more.</p>
<p>Aurelius, who all the cost had borne,</p>
<p>Cursed the day that ever he was born.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ quoth he, ‘the promise that I made</p>
<p>Of purest gold a thousand pound in weight</p>
<p>To this philosopher! What shall I do?</p>
<p>I see I must be ruined by loving, too!</p>
<p>My inheritance I needs must sell,</p>
<p>And be a beggar – here I may not dwell,</p>
<p>To shame all my kindred in this place –</p>
<p>And yet he may reveal a better grace.</p>
<p>For nonetheless, perhaps, I might assay</p>
<p>On certain days, year by year, to pay,</p>
<p>And thank him then for his great courtesy.</p>
<p>My word I will keep; no lies for me.’</p>
<p>With sore heart he went to his coffer,</p>
<p>And took his gold to the philosopher,</p>
<p>In value, some five hundred pounds I guess,</p>
<p>And beseeched him, of his gentleness,</p>
<p>To grant him time to pay the remainder;</p>
<p>And said: ‘Master, this boast I make here,</p>
<p>I’ve never failed of my word as yet.</p>
<p>Be sure, I will be quit of all the debt</p>
<p>Towards you, however I may fare,</p>
<p>Though it mean I must beg, and go bare.</p>
<p>If you would vouchsafe, on security,</p>
<p>To give me respite for two years or three,</p>
<p>All would be well, for else I must sell</p>
<p>My heritage; there is no more to tell.’</p>
<p>The philosopher soberly him answered,</p>
<p>And said thus, when he the words had heard:</p>
<p>‘Did I not keep covenant with thee?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, and well and truly, too,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘Did you not win your lady, tell no lie?’</p>
<p>‘No, no,’ quoth he, and sorrowfully did sigh.</p>
<p>‘What was the reason? Tell me if you can.’</p>
<p>Aurelius his tale anon began,</p>
<p>And told him all that you have heard before;</p>
<p>No need for me to tell it you once more.</p>
<p>He said: ‘Arveragus, in his nobleness,</p>
<p>Would rather die in sorrow and distress,</p>
<p>Than let his wife to her word be false.’</p>
<p>Dorigen’s sorrow also he told him of,</p>
<p>How loath she was to prove a wicked wife,</p>
<p>Would rather that day have lost her life,</p>
<p>And that she gave her word in all innocence;</p>
<p>She’d never heard of magical disappearance.</p>
<p>‘It made me feel for her such deep pity,</p>
<p>That as freely as he sent her to me,</p>
<p>As freely I sent her to him again.</p>
<p>That’s the long and short; the sense is plain.’</p>
<p>The philosopher replied: ‘My dear brother,</p>
<p>Each of you dealt nobly with the other.</p>
<p>You are a squire, and he is a knight;</p>
<p>But God forbid, in His blissful might,</p>
<p>That a clerk may not do a noble deed</p>
<p>As well as either of you may, indeed!</p>
<p>Sire, I release you from your thousand pounds,</p>
<p>As if you had but now crept out of the ground,</p>
<p>And never, before now, had known of me.</p>
<p>For sire, I will not take a penny from thee</p>
<p>For all my skill, no, naught for my travail.</p>
<p>You have paid well for my bread and ale;</p>
<p>That is enough, and so farewell, good day!’</p>
<p>And then to horse, and forth he took his way.</p>
<p>Lordings, this question will I ask you now:</p>
<p>Who was the most generous, sayest thou?</p>
<p>Now tell me that, ere you farther wend!</p>
<p>I can no more; my tale is at an end.</p>

<p>There was, or so says Titus Livius,</p>
<p>A knight, who was named Virginius,</p>
<p>Filled with all honour and nobility,</p>
<p>Rich in friends he was, and as wealthy.</p>
<p>This knight had a daughter by his wife;</p>
<p>He’d had no other child throughout his life.</p>
<p>Fair was this maid, of outstanding beauty</p>
<p>Beyond all others whom a man might see;</p>
<p>For Nature had with sovereign diligence</p>
<p>Created her of such great excellence</p>
<p>As if to say: ‘Behold how, I, Nature,</p>
<p>Thus can form and tint a living creature</p>
<p>When I so choose! Who can this counterfeit?</p>
<p>Not Pygmalion, though he forge and beat,</p>
<p>And carve and paint, nor, I would maintain,</p>
<p>Apelles, Zeuxis who would work in vain</p>
<p>If they should carve, and paint, and forge, and beat,</p>
<p>Presuming to create a counterfeit.</p>
<p>For the Maker, and the Principal,</p>
<p>Appointed me his Vicar-General</p>
<p>To form and fashion earthly creatures</p>
<p>As I wish: all things are in my power</p>
<p>Under the moon that doth wane and wax,</p>
<p>And for my work no payment do I ask;  </p>
<p>My Lord and I are both of one accord.</p>
<p>I made her to the honour of my Lord;</p>
<p>So I do with all my other creatures,</p>
<p>Whatever hue they have, or features.’</p>
<p>– Thus it seems to me Nature should say.</p>
<p>Fourteen years of age was then this maid,</p>
<p>In whom Nature took such great delight;</p>
<p>For just as she can paint the lily white,</p>
<p>And red the rose, just then such a picture</p>
<p>Had she painted in this noble creature,</p>
<p>Ere she was born, tinting her limbs free,</p>
<p>Wherever the colour should rightly be.</p>
<p>And Phoebus dyed her tresses all complete,</p>
<p>Like to the streams of his burnished heat.</p>
<p>And if she was excellent in beauty,</p>
<p>A thousand times more virtuous was she.</p>
<p>Within her there was lacking no condition</p>
<p>To draw praise from people of discretion.</p>
<p>As much in soul as body chaste was she,</p>
<p>So that she flowered in her virginity</p>
<p>With true humility and abstinence,</p>
<p>With true temperance and with patience,</p>
<p>Restrained in her behaviour and array.</p>
<p>Discreet she was in answering, always,</p>
<p>Though she was wise as Pallas, I dare say;</p>
<p>Her eloquence womanly, without display;</p>
<p>No affected language ever did she</p>
<p>Employ to seem wise, but in her degree</p>
<p>She spoke, and all her words, great and less,</p>
<p>Conducive were to virtue and gentleness.</p>
<p>Modest she was, in her maiden chasteness,</p>
<p>Constant in heart, and in action tireless</p>
<p>Not wishing to be thought idle, lazy.</p>
<p>Bacchus had of her mouth no mastery;</p>
<p>For wine and youth do Venus’ works increase,</p>
<p>Like a fire on which men cast oil or grease.</p>
<p>And of her own virtue, unconstrained,</p>
<p>She had many times an illness feigned,</p>
<p>So that she might flee the company</p>
<p>When there was likelihood of foolery,</p>
<p>As at a feast, a revel, or a dance</p>
<p>Which are occasions oft for dalliance.</p>
<p>Such things indeed may make our daughters be</p>
<p>Ripe and bold too soon, as men may see,</p>
<p>Dangerously so, as has been known before;</p>
<p>For all too soon they practice more and more</p>
<p>Their boldness, when they seek to play the wife.</p>
<p>And you fair mistresses, in later life,</p>
<p>Who have lords’ daughters in your governance –</p>
<p>Be not offended by my words, perchance –</p>
<p>Consider, you’ve been set to governing</p>
<p>Lords’ daughters for one of two things:</p>
<p>Either because you kept your chastity,</p>
<p>Or else because you fell, from frailty,</p>
<p>And know it well enough, the ancient dance,</p>
<p>And have forsaken fully such mischance</p>
<p>For evermore; therefore, for Christ’s sake,</p>
<p>Teach them virtue now, and make no mistake.</p>
<p>A poacher of venison who is long past</p>
<p>His guilty acts, and leaves off his old craft</p>
<p>Makes the best gamekeeper of any man.</p>
<p>So guard them well, for if you wish you can.</p>
<p>Be careful that to no vice you assent,</p>
<p>Lest you be dammed for your foul intent;</p>
<p>For one who shall, a traitor is, for certain.</p>
<p>And take good note of all that I shall say:</p>
<p>Of all treasons, the crowning pestilence</p>
<p>Is when an act betrays pure innocence.</p>
<p>You fathers, and you mothers too, also,</p>
<p>Whether you have one child or more, know</p>
<p>You’re responsible for their surveillance</p>
<p>While they remain within your governance.</p>
<p>Beware then, lest, by your mode of living,</p>
<p>Or by your negligence in chastising,</p>
<p>They perish by your example; I dare say</p>
<p>If they do so, then shall you dearly pay.</p>
<p>Under a shepherd slack and negligent</p>
<p>The wolf will many a sheep and lamb have rent.</p>
<p>Let that one example suffice me here,</p>
<p>For I must turn again to my true matter.</p>
<p>This maid, the tale of whom I now express,</p>
<p>Governing herself, needed no mistresses.</p>
<p>In her mode of life, maidens might read,</p>
<p>As in a book, every good word or deed</p>
<p>That belongs to such a maiden virtuous,</p>
<p>So prudent she, so meritorious,</p>
<p>Such that her fame was known on every side,</p>
<p>That of her beauty and her goodness, wide</p>
<p>Throughout the land, praised by everyone</p>
<p>Who loved virtue, save the envious alone,</p>
<p>For Envy is grieved by other men’s wealth,</p>
<p>And glad of their sorrow, and of their ill-health –</p>
<p>Augustine is the source of that description.  </p>
<p>This maid upon a day went into town</p>
<p>Towards a temple, with her mother dear,</p>
<p>As is the manner of young maidens here.</p>
<p>Now, there was then a justice in that town</p>
<p>Governor of the region all around;</p>
<p>And it befell, that the judge his eyes cast</p>
<p>Upon this maid, his gaze there held fast,</p>
<p>As she passed the place in which he stood.</p>
<p>Anon his heart changed and his mood.</p>
<p>So caught was he by the beauty of this maid.</p>
<p>And to himself all secretly he said:</p>
<p>‘This maid shall be mine, before any man!’</p>
<p>Anon the devil into his heart now ran,</p>
<p>And taught him swiftly that by some sleight</p>
<p>Of hand, he the maid to his purpose might</p>
<p>Win, for through force or bribery indeed</p>
<p>He saw no way in which he might succeed,</p>
<p>For she was rich in friends, and also she</p>
<p>Was so confirmed in her virtuous duty,</p>
<p>That he knew well he might never win</p>
<p>Her mind or body to indulge in sin.</p>
<p>So after deliberating, casting round,</p>
<p>He sent for a rogue living in the town,</p>
<p>Whom he knew was subtle and was bold.</p>
<p>The justice to this rogue his tale told,</p>
<p>In secrecy, and told him to be sure</p>
<p>Never to tell it to another creature,</p>
<p>For if he did, he would lose his head.</p>
<p>When the cursed reed had thus assented,</p>
<p>The judge was glad, and gave him good cheer,</p>
<p>And gifts as well, gifts both precious and dear.</p>
<p>When shaped was all their conspiracy</p>
<p>In every detail, how his lechery</p>
<p>Was to be satisfied full subtly –</p>
<p>As you shall hear soon, and openly –</p>
<p>Home went the rogue, his name was Claudius.</p>
<p>The false judge, whose name was Appius –</p>
<p>Such was his name, for this is no fable,</p>
<p>But is known to history, and notable;</p>
<p>The substance of it, true, without a doubt –</p>
<p>This false judge now went fast about</p>
<p>To hurry on his crime as best he may.</p>
<p>And it befell, soon after, on a day,</p>
<p>The false justice, for so says the story,</p>
<p>As was his right, playing judge and jury,</p>
<p>Was giving his judgement in another case.</p>
<p>The false rogue rushed in on him apace,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Lord, if it might be your will,</p>
<p>Grant me my rights regarding this true bill,</p>
<p>A bill of complaint against Virginius.</p>
<p>And if he denies that things are thus,</p>
<p>I will prove them so, and find good witness</p>
<p>The truth is as my bill doth here express’</p>
<p>The judge replied: ‘In the defendant’s absence</p>
<p>I cannot bring this new case to sentence.</p>
<p>Summon him, then you I’ll gladly hear;</p>
<p>You shall have justice, not injustice here.’</p>
<p>Virginius came, to learn the judge’s will,</p>
<p>And right anon was read the cursed bill.</p>
<p>The content of it was as you shall hear:</p>
<p>‘To you, my lord Sir Appius so dear,</p>
<p>Declares your humble servant Claudius</p>
<p>That a knight, named here, Virginius,</p>
<p>Against the law, against all equity,</p>
<p>Holds, and against my will, most expressly,</p>
<p>My servant, one who is my thrall by right,</p>
<p>One that was stolen from my house by night</p>
<p>When she was very young; this will I prove</p>
<p>By witnesses, my lord, if you approve.</p>
<p>She’s not his child, whatever he may say.</p>
<p>Wherefore to you, my lord the judge, I say,</p>
<p>Yield me my thrall now, if it be your will!’</p>
<p>Lo, this was all the content of his bill.</p>
<p>Virginius stared in horror at the rogue;</p>
<p>But swiftly, before his tale could be told,</p>
<p>And he reveal the truth, as a knight,</p>
<p>Call witnesses to demonstrate his right,</p>
<p>And show the falseness of his adversary,</p>
<p>The cursed judge who would no longer tarry,</p>
<p>Nor hear a word more from Virginius,</p>
<p>Issued his judgement and declared it thus:</p>
<p>‘This man shall have his servant, I rule so.</p>
<p>You shall no longer keep her, you must go</p>
<p>And bring her forth, and make her now our ward.</p>
<p>The man shall have his thrall, so I award.’</p>
<p>And when this worthy knight Virginius,</p>
<p>Heard the decree of this judge, Appius,</p>
<p>That he by force must his dear daughter give</p>
<p>Up to the judge, in lechery to live,</p>
<p>He went back home, and sat down in his hall,</p>
<p>And anon had them his daughter call;</p>
<p>And with a face dead as ashes cold</p>
<p>Her humble face did silently behold,</p>
<p>A father’s pity striking through his heart,</p>
<p>Yet from his purpose he could not depart.</p>
<p>‘Daughter,’ quoth he, ‘Virginia, by thy name,</p>
<p>There are two ways before you, death or shame,</p>
<p>One you must suffer – alas, that I was born!</p>
<p>For you have not deserved this evil morn,</p>
<p>Yet must you die by sword or by the knife.</p>
<p>O dear daughter, ender of my life,</p>
<p>Whom I have nurtured with such joyous glance</p>
<p>You were never out of my remembrance,</p>
<p>O daughter, you who are my final woe,</p>
<p>And of my life are my last joy also,</p>
<p>O gem of chastity, with quiet patience</p>
<p>Embrace your death: such is my sentence.</p>
<p>For love, not hate, I would have you dead;</p>
<p>My pitying hand must strike off your head.</p>
<p>Alas, that ever Appius saw your face!</p>
<p>That is why he falsely judged the case’ –</p>
<p>He told her all the tale you’ve heard before.</p>
<p>No need for me to tell you of it more.</p>
<p>‘O mercy, dear father!’ quoth the maid,</p>
<p>And with that both her arms she laid</p>
<p>About his neck, as she was wont to do.</p>
<p>The tears burst from her eyes, anew,</p>
<p>‘Good father,’ she cried, ‘is it death for me?</p>
<p>Is there no grace? Is there no remedy?’</p>
<p>‘No, none, dear daughter mine,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘Then give me time, father mine,’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘To lament my death a little space.</p>
<p>For Jephtha he gave his daughter grace,</p>
<p>To lament before he slew her, alas!</p>
<p>And God knows she committed no trespass,</p>
<p>But ran, the first her father chanced to see,</p>
<p>To welcome him with great solemnity.’</p>
<p>And with these words she swooned anon.</p>
<p>And after, when her faintness was all gone,</p>
<p>She arose, and to her father said:</p>
<p>‘Blessed be God that I shall die a maid!</p>
<p>Grant me death, before I come to shame.</p>
<p>Do with your child as you will, in God’s name!’</p>
<p>After those words she begged him full oft,</p>
<p>That with his sword he would smite soft;</p>
<p>And then again she fainted and lay still.</p>
<p>Her father with a sorrowful heart and will,</p>
<p>Struck off her head, gripped the hair, and went</p>
<p>To seek the judge, so as to present</p>
<p>Her head to him, being judge and jury,</p>
<p>And when the judge saw it, says the story,</p>
<p>He bade men to take and hang him fast.</p>
<p>But right anon a thousand people passed</p>
<p>Into the yard, to save the knight, for pity,</p>
<p>Since all was known of this false iniquity.</p>
<p>The people had suspicions that the thing,</p>
<p>From the way in which the rogue sought to bring</p>
<p>His charge, had the consent of Appius;</p>
<p>They knew too that he was lecherous.</p>
<p>And so to seek this Appius had they gone,</p>
<p>To throw him into prison right anon,</p>
<p>Where he slew himself; and Claudius,</p>
<p>Who was the servant to this Appius,</p>
<p>Was sentenced to hang upon a tree,</p>
<p>But Virginius, out of clemency,</p>
<p>Prayed that instead he might be exiled;</p>
<p>Or else for sure he would have died reviled.</p>
<p>The rest were hanged, the greater and the less,</p>
<p>Who were accessories to this wickedness.</p>
<p>Here may men see how sin receives its due!</p>
<p>Beware, no man knows what rank or who</p>
<p>God will smite, nor in what manner or wise;</p>
<p>The worm of conscience may yet arise</p>
<p>Against the wicked life, though secretly</p>
<p>So no man knows of it but God and he.</p>
<p>For be he illiterate or be he learned,</p>
<p>He knows not how soon the blow is earned.</p>
<p>Therefore I advise you this counsel take:</p>
<p>Forsake sin, before sin may you forsake.</p>

<p>Our Host began to swear as he were mad;</p>
<p>‘By nails and blood,’ quoth he, ‘your tale is sad!</p>
<p>This was a false rogue and a false assize!</p>
<p>As shameful a death as heart may devise</p>
<p>Come to these judges and their advocates!</p>
<p>And yet this faultless maid has met her fate!</p>
<p>Alas, too dearly did she buy her beauty!</p>
<p>Wherefore I always say that men may see</p>
<p>That the gifts of Fortune and of Nature</p>
<p>Have caused the death of many a creature.</p>
<p>From both the gifts that I spoke of now</p>
<p>Man often has more harm than good I vow.</p>
<p>‘But truly now, my own master dear,</p>
<p>That was indeed a piteous tale to hear!</p>
<p>And to pass on, now, is scarce a curse.</p>
<p>I pray, God bless your noble person, first,</p>
<p>Your glass urinals, and sundry vessels,</p>
<p>Your hippocras too, and your cordials,</p>
<p>And every box of your apothecary’s –</p>
<p>God bless them, and our Lady Saint Mary!</p>
<p>For, may I prosper, you’re a proper man,</p>
<p>And like a prelate, by Saint Ronian!</p>
<p>Say I not well? I cannot use your terms</p>
<p>But I know you gave my heart such a turn,</p>
<p>That I have almost caught a cardiacle.</p>
<p>By God’s bones, unless I dose a little,</p>
<p>Or drink a draught of moist and malted ale,</p>
<p>Or hear anon a somewhat merrier tale,</p>
<p>My heart is lost for pity of this maid!</p>
<p>You bel ami, you, Pardoner,’ he said,</p>
<p>‘Give us some mirth or jest now, right anon.’</p>
<p>‘It shall be done,’ quoth he, ‘by Saint Ronian.</p>
<p>Yet first,’ quoth he, ‘here at this inn’s ale-stake,</p>
<p>I will both drink and eat a piece of cake.’</p>
<p>But now from the gentlefolk there rose a plea:</p>
<p>‘Nay let him tell us no obscenities!</p>
<p>Tell us some moral thing, let there appear</p>
<p>Some wisdom, and then we will gladly hear.’</p>
<p>‘Granted, indeed,’ quoth he, ‘but I must think</p>
<p>Of some decorous thing while I go drink.’</p>

<p>‘Lordings,’ quoth he, ‘in churches when I preach,</p>
<p>I take great pains to make a forceful speech,</p>
<p>And ring it out as soundly as a bell,</p>
<p>For I know all by rote, the tale I tell.</p>
<p>My theme is ever one, and always was:</p>
<p>“Radix malorum est cupiditas.”</p>
<p>First I pronounce from whence it is I come,</p>
<p>And then my bulls I show them, all and some.</p>
<p>Our liege lord’s seal is upon my patent</p>
<p>That I show first, as my bodily warrant,</p>
<p>So that none’s so bold, priest nor clerk,</p>
<p>As to disturb me in Christ’s holy work,</p>
<p>And after that, then I tell forth my tales.</p>
<p>Bulls of the popes and of cardinals,</p>
<p>Of patriarchs and bishops too, they view,</p>
<p>And in Latin I speak a word or two,</p>
<p>To season, as with saffron, declamation,</p>
<p>And stir them to reveal all their devotion.</p>
<p>Then I show forth my large crystal flagons,</p>
<p>Crammed full to the top with rags and bones;</p>
<p>Relics they are, adored by everyone.</p>
<p>Then I have in brass a shoulder-bone,</p>
<p>Belong to a holy Jew’s dead sheep.</p>
<p>“Good men,” say I, “note of my words now keep:</p>
<p>If that this bone be washed in any well,</p>
<p>If cow, or calf, or sheep, or ox should swell</p>
<p>That any worm has eat, or snake has stung,</p>
<p>Take water from that well and wash its tongue,</p>
<p>It will be whole anon; and furthermore,</p>
<p>Of pox and scabs and every other sore</p>
<p>Shall every sheep be whole that of this well</p>
<p>Drinks a draught. Take note of what I tell:</p>
<p>If the good man that the beasts do follow</p>
<p>Shall every week, before the cockerels crow,</p>
<p>Fasting too, drink of this well a draught,</p>
<p>As this holy Jew our elders taught,</p>
<p>His beasts and his stock will fruitful be.</p>
<p>And, sires, also it heals the jealousy;</p>
<p>For though a man descend to jealous rage,</p>
<p>Let him add this water to his pottage,</p>
<p>And nevermore shall he mistrust his wife,</p>
<p>Though the truth of all her sin be rife,</p>
<p>And even though she’s had a priest or three.</p>
<p>Here is a mitten too, as you can see;</p>
<p>He that his hand will put inside this mitten,</p>
<p>His grain shall multiply, as it were written,</p>
<p>Where he has sown, whether it’s wheat or oats,</p>
<p>If he makes offering of pence or groats.</p>
<p>Good men and women, one thing though I vow;</p>
<p>If anyone is in this church right now</p>
<p>Who has done dreadful things, that he</p>
<p>Dare not, for shame of it, confess to me,</p>
<p>Or any woman, be she young or old,</p>
<p>Who has made of her husband a cuckold,</p>
<p>Such folk shall have no power and no grace</p>
<p>To make offering to my relics in this place.</p>
<p>And whoever’s free of all such blame,</p>
<p>May come and make an offering, in God’s name,</p>
<p>And I absolve them, by the authority</p>
<p>This papal bull has granted unto me.”</p>
<p>By this trick have I gained, year on year,</p>
<p>A hundred marks since I made Pardoner.</p>
<p>I stand like a cleric in my pulpit,</p>
<p>And after the unlettered people sit,</p>
<p>I preach thus as you have heard before,</p>
<p>And tell a hundred false stories more.</p>
<p>Then I take to stretching forth my neck,</p>
<p>And east and west nod with due effect,</p>
<p>Just like a dove sitting on a barn.</p>
<p>My hands and tongue then work so hard</p>
<p>That it is a joy to view the business.</p>
<p>Of avarice and all such wickedness</p>
<p>Is all my preaching, thus to set them free</p>
<p>To give their pence, and namely, unto me.</p>
<p>For my intent is only gain to win,</p>
<p>Not to correct them when they chance to sin.</p>
<p>For I care nothing, at their burying,</p>
<p>Whether their souls have gone blackberrying!</p>
<p>And certainly, many a declamation</p>
<p>Arises oftentime from ill intention:</p>
<p>Sometime to pleasure folk with flattery,</p>
<p>And gain advantage through hypocrisy,</p>
<p>Sometimes for vainglory, sometimes hate.</p>
<p>For when I dare not otherwise debate,</p>
<p>I’ll sting him with my tongue and sharp</p>
<p>Preaching, so that he’ll not flee far</p>
<p>From false slander, if it seems that he</p>
<p>Has offended my brethren now, or me.</p>
<p>For though I never speak his proper name,</p>
<p>Men shall know the person, all the same,</p>
<p>By signs and by other circumstances.</p>
<p>Thus I pay out folk who lead us dances;</p>
<p>Thus I spit out my venom with the hue</p>
<p>Of holiness, to seem holy still and true.</p>
<p>But briefly my intent I here confess:</p>
<p>I preach, but only out of covetousness.</p>
<p>Therefore my theme is now, and ever was:</p>
<p>“Radix malorum est cupiditas.”</p>
<p>Thus do I preach against the very vice</p>
<p>I too indulge in, which is avarice.</p>
<p>Though I myself am guilty of that sin,</p>
<p>Yet I have power these other folk to win</p>
<p>From avarice, and bitterly to repent.</p>
<p>Yet that is not my principal intent;</p>
<p>I preach only out of covetousness.</p>
<p>Enough now of that subject, I suggest.</p>
<p>Then I give examples many a one</p>
<p>Out of old stories from the times long gone.</p>
<p>For unlettered people love the tales of old;</p>
<p>Such things they can repeat, their minds can hold.</p>
<p>What! Think you, that while I can preach,</p>
<p>And gain gold and silver as I teach,</p>
<p>I would live in poverty wilfully?</p>
<p>Nay, nay, I’ve never thought so, truly!</p>
<p>For I can preach and beg in sundry lands.</p>
<p>I need never labour with my hands,</p>
<p>Nor make baskets, just to make a living,</p>
<p>Since not un-fruitfully I can go begging;</p>
<p>None of the apostles shall I counterfeit.</p>
<p>I must have money, wool, cheese and wheat,</p>
<p>Though it were given by the poorest page</p>
<p>Or the poorest widow in some village,</p>
<p>Though her children starve from famine.</p>
<p>Nay, I must drink the liquor of the vine,</p>
<p>And have a jolly wench in every town!</p>
<p>But hearken, lordings, in conclusion now:</p>
<p>Your pleasure is that I should tell a tale.</p>
<p>Now I have drunk a draught of malted ale,</p>
<p>By God, I hope to tell you of a thing</p>
<p>That shall with reason be to your liking!</p>
<p>For though myself I am a sinful man,</p>
<p>Tell you a moral tale? Well, that I can:</p>
<p>One that I am wont to preach for gain.</p>
<p>Now hold your peace; and I’ll begin again.’</p>

<p>In Flanders once there was a company</p>
<p>Of younger folk given all to folly,</p>
<p>Such as riot, gambling, brothels, taverns,</p>
<p>Where to the harps and lutes, and to citherns,</p>
<p>They danced, and played at dice both day and night,</p>
<p>And ate and drank more than wise men might,</p>
<p>Offering thereby the devil sacrifice</p>
<p>Within that devil’s temple of cursed vice,</p>
<p>With superfluity abominable.</p>
<p>Their oaths were so great and damnable</p>
<p>That it was terrible to hear them swear;</p>
<p>Our blessed Lord’s body thus they’d tear –</p>
<p>As though the Jews had not torn him enough –</p>
<p>And each of them at other sinners laughed.</p>
<p>And then anon came female tumblers,</p>
<p>Slender and elegant, young fruiterers,</p>
<p>Singers with harps, bawds, wafer-sellers,</p>
<p>Who are the devil’s very own officers,</p>
<p>To kindle and blow the fire of lechery,</p>
<p>Which is annexed indeed to gluttony.</p>
<p>The Holy Writ I take now as my witness</p>
<p>There’s lechery in wine and drunkenness.</p>
<p>See, how your drunken Lot unnaturally</p>
<p>Lay with his two daughters, unknowingly;</p>
<p>So drunk was he, he knew not what he wrought.</p>
<p>Herod, whoever of the tale knows aught,</p>
<p>When he was replete with wine at a feast,</p>
<p>At his own table ordered, like any beast,</p>
<p>The slaying of John the Baptist, guiltless.</p>
<p>Seneca too says a good thing, doubtless:</p>
<p>He says, there’s no difference he can find</p>
<p>Between some fellow who has lost his mind</p>
<p>And one who is a drunkard through and through,</p>
<p>But says that madness, when it overcomes you</p>
<p>Lasts longer than does ever drunkenness.</p>
<p>O gluttony, so full of wickedness!</p>
<p>O thou reason for our first confusion!</p>
<p>O original cause of our damnation,</p>
<p>Till Christ bought us with his blood again!</p>
<p>See, how costly, briefly to explain,</p>
<p>The payment for that cursed villainy;</p>
<p>Corrupted was this world by gluttony.</p>
<p>Adam our father, and his wife also,</p>
<p>From Paradise, to labour and to woe,</p>
<p>Were driven for that vice, it’s so indeed.</p>
<p>For while Adam fasted, as I read,</p>
<p>He was in Paradise, and when he</p>
<p>Ate the forbidden fruit from the tree,</p>
<p>Then he was cast out to woe and pain.</p>
<p>O gluttony, of whom we should complain!</p>
<p>O, if men knew how many maladies</p>
<p>Follow from excess and gluttony,</p>
<p>They would be more temperate and careful</p>
<p>In their diet, when they sit at table.</p>
<p>Alas, the narrow throat, the tender mouth</p>
<p>Mean men east and west, and north and south,</p>
<p>In earth, air, water, labour, as I think,</p>
<p>Simply to bring a glutton food and drink!</p>
<p>Of this matter, O Paul, you also treat:</p>
<p>‘Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meat,</p>
<p>But God shall destroy both.’ So Paul says.</p>
<p>Alas, a foul thing it is, by my faith,</p>
<p>To speak the word, and fouler is the deed,</p>
<p>When man so drinks of white and red indeed,</p>
<p>That of his throat he makes his privy</p>
<p>By reason of cursed superfluity.</p>
<p>The Apostle says, whom weeping softens:</p>
<p>‘For many walk, of whom I’ve told you often,</p>
<p>And now tell you, even weeping, that they</p>
<p>Are enemies of the cross of Christ always:</p>
<p>Whose ending is destruction, and whose God</p>
<p>Is their belly!’ O womb, O stinking pod,</p>
<p>Filled full with dung and with corruption,</p>
<p>At either end, foul is the eruption!</p>
<p>What labour and cost it is your meat to find!</p>
<p>These cooks, how they stamp and strain and grind,</p>
<p>To turn God’s substance into accident,</p>
<p>To quench your avid lust, by their talent.</p>
<p>Out of the hard bone the marrow they</p>
<p>Knock, for nothing of it is thrown away</p>
<p>That softly, sweetly may the gullet suit.</p>
<p>Spices of every leaf, and bark, and root</p>
<p>Shall help to make the sauces of delight</p>
<p>That feed again a newer appetite.</p>
<p>And surely he who lives on such spices</p>
<p>Is dead, while he lives among these vices.</p>
<p>A lecherous thing is wine, and drunkenness</p>
<p>Is full of strife and of wretchedness.</p>
<p>O drunken man, disfigured is your face,</p>
<p>Sour is your breath, and foul is your embrace!</p>
<p>And through your nose issues a dull tone</p>
<p>As though you said: ‘Sampson, Sampson’.</p>
<p>– And yet, God knows, Sampson drank no wine.</p>
<p>You fall to the ground like a fresh-stuck swine;</p>
<p>Your tongue is lost, and every decent care,</p>
<p>For drunkenness is the very sepulchre</p>
<p>Of a man’s reason and discretion.</p>
<p>He, over whom drink has domination,</p>
<p>Can keep no counsel, as is truly said.</p>
<p>So keep you from the white and from the red,</p>
<p>The white from Lepé, Spain, then, set aside</p>
<p>That they sell in Fish Street and Cheapside!</p>
<p>That wine of Spain creeps most subtly, ay,</p>
<p>Into the other wines they cask nearby,</p>
<p>From which there rises such fumosity</p>
<p>That when a man has drunk of glasses three,</p>
<p>And thinks himself at home in Cheapside,</p>
<p>Yet he in Spain, in Lepé town, will abide –</p>
<p>Not at La Rochelle, nor in Bordeaux’s sun –</p>
<p>And then he will drone out: ‘Sampson, Sampson.’</p>
<p>But hearken, lordings, one word more I pray,</p>
<p>Know the sovereign acts, all, I dare say,</p>
<p>Of victory in the entire Old Testament,</p>
<p>Won through God who is omnipotent,</p>
<p>Were won in abstinence and prayer.</p>
<p>Look to your Bible, and find it there.</p>
<p>Look at Attila, the great conqueror,</p>
<p>Dead in his sleep, in shame and dishonour,</p>
<p>Bleeding from his nose in drunkenness;</p>
<p>A general should be sober, I’d suggest!</p>
<p>Moreover, consider now right well,</p>
<p>What was commanded of Lemuel –</p>
<p>Not Samuel, but Lemuel say I –</p>
<p>Read your Bible, see there if I lie,</p>
<p>On wining those with whom justice lies.</p>
<p>No more of this, let my words suffice.</p>
<p>And now that I have spoken of gluttony,</p>
<p>Now will I warn you about gambling’s lottery.</p>
<p>Gambling’s the very mother of lying,</p>
<p>And of deceit and cursed forswearing,</p>
<p>Blaspheming Christ, manslaughter, waste also</p>
<p>Of property and time, and further know,</p>
<p>It is shame and contrary to honour,</p>
<p>To be known as a common gambler,</p>
<p>And ever the higher his estate,</p>
<p>The more is he shunned and desolate.</p>
<p>If a prince choose to play the lottery,</p>
<p>In all his governance and policy,</p>
<p>He is held, by common opinion,</p>
<p>As the last of all in reputation.</p>
<p>Stilbon, who was a wise ambassador,</p>
<p>Was sent to Corinth, with all honour,</p>
<p>From Lacadaemon, to make alliance,</p>
<p>And on arrival, it occurred by chance</p>
<p>That all the greatest men of that land</p>
<p>He found gambling, with the die in hand.</p>
<p>So, as soon as might reasonably be,</p>
<p>He stole home again to his own country,</p>
<p>And said: ‘There I’ll not lose my name,</p>
<p>Nor will I take on me so great a shame</p>
<p>As to ally you with all these gamblers.</p>
<p>Send some other wise ambassadors;</p>
<p>For, in truth, indeed, I’d rather die</p>
<p>Than I should you to gamblers ally.</p>
<p>You who are so glorious in honours</p>
<p>Shall not ally yourselves with gamblers</p>
<p>By any will of mine, nor any treaty.’</p>
<p>That wise philosopher, so said he.</p>
<p>Look also to that King Demetrius:</p>
<p>The King of Parthia, as books tell us,</p>
<p>Sent him a pair of golden dice in scorn,</p>
<p>Since he’d shown as a gambler before;</p>
<p>For which reason his glory and renown</p>
<p>He valued naught, nor his reputation.</p>
<p>Lords can find other, better ways to play</p>
<p>Honest enough to pass the day away.</p>
<p>Now will I speak of oaths false and great</p>
<p>A word or two, as the old books treat.</p>
<p>Swearing is a thing abominable,</p>
<p>And perjury is even more objectionable.</p>
<p>God on high forbade swearing at all;</p>
<p>Witness Matthew, but you may recall</p>
<p>That to which Jeremiah gave breath:</p>
<p>‘And thou shalt swear, as the Lord liveth,</p>
<p>In truth, in judgement, and in righteousness.’</p>
<p>But idle swearing is pure wickedness.</p>
<p>Behold and see, how in the first table</p>
<p>Of God’s commandments honourable,</p>
<p>The third commandment was written plain:</p>
<p>‘Thou shalt not take the Lord’s name in vain.’</p>
<p>See how He rather forbade such swearing</p>
<p>Before homicide, and other cursed things!</p>
<p>I say that higher in the list it stands;</p>
<p>This they know who know His commands,</p>
<p>That God’s third commandment is that.</p>
<p>And moreover, I will tell you flat</p>
<p>That vengeance shall fall on all his house</p>
<p>Whose oaths and swearing are outrageous.</p>
<p>‘By God’s precious heart, and by his nails,</p>
<p>And by the blood of Christ that is at Hailes,</p>
<p>Seven’s my number, yours is five and three!</p>
<p>By God’s arms, if you play false with me,</p>
<p>This sharp dagger through your heart shall go!’</p>
<p>Such is the fruit of those two cursed bones:</p>
<p>Perjury, anger, cheating, homicide.</p>
<p>Now, for the love of Jesus Christ who died</p>
<p>For us, leave off your oaths, great or small.</p>
<p>But sires, now of my tale will I tell all.</p>
<p>These three profligates of whom I tell,</p>
<p>Long before prime rang out from any bell,</p>
<p>Had sat down in a tavern for a drink.</p>
<p>And as they sat, they heard a bell clink</p>
<p>Before a coffin carried to the grave.</p>
<p>Then one of them called to his knave:</p>
<p>‘Go quickly,’ quoth he, ‘and ask reply</p>
<p>As to whose corpse this is passing by;</p>
<p>And remember the name aright, as well.’</p>
<p>‘Sire,’ quoth the boy, ‘no need that they tell;</p>
<p>I heard it before you came these two hours,</p>
<p>He was, in truth, an old friend of yours,</p>
<p>Who was suddenly slain the other night,</p>
<p>Drunk, as he lay upon his bench upright.</p>
<p>There came a sly thief whom men call Death,</p>
<p>Who in this country steals people’s breath,</p>
<p>And with his spear his heart he smote so,</p>
<p>And on his way without a word did go.</p>
<p>He slew a thousand with the pestilence.</p>
<p>And, master, ere you reach his presence,</p>
<p>I think it very wise and necessary</p>
<p>To be wary of such an adversary.</p>
<p>Be ready to meet him at every door –</p>
<p>So my mother taught me; now, no more.’</p>
<p>‘By Saint Mary!’ said the innkeeper,</p>
<p>‘The child is right, for he has slain this year,</p>
<p>Barely a mile from here, in a large village,</p>
<p>Men and women, children, serfs at tillage.</p>
<p>I think his habitation must be there.</p>
<p>It would be wise indeed to take care,</p>
<p>Lest he should do a man dishonour.’</p>
<p>‘What, God’s arms,’ quoth the reveller,</p>
<p>‘Is it so perilous then with him to meet?</p>
<p>I’ll seek him on the highway, in the street,</p>
<p>I make this vow by God’s noble bones!</p>
<p>Hearken, friends, we three are all as one:</p>
<p>Let each man hold his hand up to the others,</p>
<p>And each to each become as brothers.</p>
<p>And we shall slay this false traitor Death!</p>
<p>He shall be slain, who steals men’s breath,</p>
<p>By God’s dignity, ere it be night!’</p>
<p>Together the three their troth did plight,</p>
<p>To live and die each of them for the other,</p>
<p>As though he were his own born brother,</p>
<p>And up they leapt, all drunk and in a rage,</p>
<p>And forth they went towards the village</p>
<p>Of which the innkeeper had told before.</p>
<p>And many a grisly oath then they swore,</p>
<p>And Christ’s blessed body tore and rent;</p>
<p>Death shall die: to catch him their intent!</p>
<p>When they had gone barely half a mile,</p>
<p>Just as they were about to leap a stile,</p>
<p>An old man, a poor man, there they met.</p>
<p>The old man humbly paid them his respects,</p>
<p>And spoke thus: ‘Now lords, may God protect ye!’</p>
<p>The proudest then of these profligates three</p>
<p>Answered again: What, knave of sorry grace!</p>
<p>Why are you all cloaked save for your face?</p>
<p>Why have you lived so long, in your old age?’</p>
<p>The old man stared hard into his visage,</p>
<p>And spoke thus: ‘Because I cannot find</p>
<p>Any man, though I have walked to Inde,</p>
<p>Neither in city, nor in distant village,</p>
<p>Who will exchange his youth for my age.</p>
<p>And therefore have I all my years still,</p>
<p>As long as it may further the Lord’s will.</p>
<p>No death, alas, will take away my life!</p>
<p>So I wander on, wretched, and in strife,</p>
<p>And at the ground, which is my mother’s gate,</p>
<p>I knock with my staff, both early and late,</p>
<p>Crying: “Dear mother, please let me in!</p>
<p>See, how I waste, flesh and blood and skin!</p>
<p>Alas, when shall my bones be at rest?</p>
<p>Mother, with you I would exchange the chest</p>
<p>That in my chamber has a long time been</p>
<p>Yea, for a hair-shirt to wrap round me!”</p>
<p>– But yet to me she will not show that grace,</p>
<p>And so all pale and wrinkled is my face.</p>
<p>But sires, you show a lack of courtesy</p>
<p>In speaking to an aged man, so harshly,</p>
<p>Unless he’s trespassed in word or deed.</p>
<p>In holy writ, too, you yourself may read:</p>
<p>“Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head”,</p>
<p>Therefore I give you my advice, ‘tis said,</p>
<p>Unto an old man no harm should you do,</p>
<p>More than you would have men do unto you</p>
<p>In age, if here it chance you long abide.</p>
<p>And God be with you, where you go or ride!</p>
<p>I must go thither where I have to go.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, old churl, by God, you shall not so!’</p>
<p>Cried the other profligate, anon.</p>
<p>‘You leave us not so lightly, by Saint John!</p>
<p>You spoke just now of that traitor Death,</p>
<p>Who in this country steals away men’s breath;</p>
<p>You have my word, as you are his spy,</p>
<p>Say where he is or you’ll pay by and by,</p>
<p>By God, and by the Holy Sacrament!</p>
<p>For truly you are both joined in consent</p>
<p>To slay us younger folk, you false thief!’</p>
<p>‘Now, sires,’ quoth he, ‘if it is your chief</p>
<p>Wish to find Death, take this crooked way,</p>
<p>For in that grove I left him, by my faith,</p>
<p>Under a tree, and there he will abide;</p>
<p>No bluster of yours will make him hide.</p>
<p>See you that oak? Just there you shall him find.</p>
<p>God save you, He that redeemed all mankind,</p>
<p>And amend you!’ – So said the aged man.</p>
<p>And every one of the profligates then ran</p>
<p>Till they came to the tree, and there they found</p>
<p>Of florins fine, of gold new-coined and round,</p>
<p>Well nigh eight bushels, was what they thought.</p>
<p>No longer then after Death they sought,</p>
<p>But each of them was pleased so at the sight,</p>
<p>Since the florins gleamed so fair and bright,</p>
<p>That down they sat beside the precious hoard.</p>
<p>The wickedest of them spoke the first word:</p>
<p>‘Brethren’ quoth he, ‘take note of what I say;</p>
<p>My wit is great, though I may jest and play.</p>
<p>This treasure now to us has Fortune given,</p>
<p>In mirth and jollity our life to live: then,</p>
<p>Lightly as it comes, so shall we spend.</p>
<p>By God’s precious dignity, this day’s end,</p>
<p>Who’d have thought it would bring so fair a grace?</p>
<p>Now might this gold be carried from this place,</p>
<p>Home to my house – or else to yours –</p>
<p>For now you see that all this gold is ours –</p>
<p>Then would we be in high felicity.</p>
<p>Yet certainly, by day that may not be.</p>
<p>Men would say we were thieves all along,</p>
<p>And for our own treasure have us hung.</p>
<p>This treasure must be carried off by night,</p>
<p>As carefully and cunningly as we might.</p>
<p>So I suggest that lots among us all</p>
<p>We draw, and see how the lots may fall;</p>
<p>And he of the short straw, with heart blithe</p>
<p>Shall run to the town, and swift and lithe,</p>
<p>And bring us bread and wine secretly.</p>
<p>And two of us will guard cunningly</p>
<p>This treasure well, and, if he not tarry,</p>
<p>When it is night we shall this treasure carry,</p>
<p>By our consent, wherever we think best.’</p>
<p>Then one of them held the straws in his fist,</p>
<p>And bade them draw, see how the lots might fall;</p>
<p>The shortest fell to the youngest of them all,</p>
<p>And forth towards the town he ran anon.</p>
<p>And as soon as ever he was gone,</p>
<p>One of them spoke thus to the other:</p>
<p>‘You know that you are my sworn brother;</p>
<p>I’ll tell you where you profit lies anon.</p>
<p>You know that our fellow is clean gone,</p>
<p>And here is gold, and that in great plenty,</p>
<p>Which is to be shared among us three.</p>
<p>Yet if it seemed that I could shape it so</p>
<p>That it were only shared between us, though,</p>
<p>Would I not show myself a friend to thee?’</p>
<p>‘The other answered him: ‘How can that be?</p>
<p>He knows the gold is here, while he’s away;</p>
<p>What could we do? What could we hope to say?’</p>
<p>‘Shall it be secret?’ said the worst of the two,</p>
<p>‘And in a few words I’ll explain it you,</p>
<p>What we shall do to bring it all about.’</p>
<p>‘I agree,’ said the other, ‘have no doubt,</p>
<p>You, by my oath, will I not betray.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ quoth the first, ‘we be two, I say,</p>
<p>And two of us then are stronger than one.</p>
<p>Look, when he is seated, then right anon</p>
<p>Rise as though with him you would play;</p>
<p>And I will stab him through the side, this way,</p>
<p>While you are struggling with him, as in game,</p>
<p>And with your dagger look you do the same.</p>
<p>And then this gold shall be shared, you see,</p>
<p>My dear friend, just between you and me.</p>
<p>Then we can both our wishes thus fulfil,</p>
<p>And play at dice according to our will.’</p>
<p>And so the two rogues agreed, and they</p>
<p>Planned to slay the third, as you heard say.</p>
<p>The youngest, while he ran towards the town,</p>
<p>Often in his thoughts rolled up and down</p>
<p>The beauty of those florins new and bright.</p>
<p>‘O Lord,’ quoth he, ‘if only that I might</p>
<p>Have all this treasure for myself alone,</p>
<p>There is no man that lives beneath the throne</p>
<p>Of God who would live as merry as me!’</p>
<p>And at last the fiend, our deadly enemy,</p>
<p>Put in his thoughts, that he should poison buy,</p>
<p>With which to slay his fellows by and by,</p>
<p>Because the fiend found his way of living</p>
<p>Was such he’d power to set him sorrowing.</p>
<p>For this was wholly his complete intent:</p>
<p>To kill them both, and never to repent.</p>
<p>And off he went – no longer would he tarry –</p>
<p>Into the town to an apothecary,</p>
<p>And requested of him that he sell</p>
<p>Him poison, a host of rats to quell,</p>
<p>And also there was a polecat in his yard,</p>
<p>That, so he said, had pressed his chickens hard,</p>
<p>And he would take revenge, if he might,</p>
<p>On vermin that stole from him at night.</p>
<p>The apothecary answered: ‘You’ll take away</p>
<p>A compound that, as God my soul may save,</p>
<p>Is such that in all this world there’s no creature</p>
<p>That has eaten or drunk of this mixture</p>
<p>Merely the quantity of a grain of wheat,</p>
<p>Who did not his life at once forfeit.</p>
<p>Yes, die he must, and in a shorter while</p>
<p>Than it would take you to walk a mile,</p>
<p>The poison is so strong and violent.’</p>
<p>The cursed wretch then swiftly went,</p>
<p>With this poison in a box, in his hand,</p>
<p>Into the neighbouring street to a man,</p>
<p>From whom he borrowed large bottles three,</p>
<p>And into two the poison then poured he;</p>
<p>The third he left empty for his drink,</p>
<p>For a full night’s labour he did think</p>
<p>To spend transporting gold from that place.</p>
<p>And when this profligate, with sorry grace,</p>
<p>Had filled with wine his large bottles three,</p>
<p>To his fellows he returned and swiftly.</p>

<p>Why make a longer sermon of it more?</p>
<p>Exactly as they’d planned his death before,</p>
<p>Right so they slew him and that anon.</p>
<p>And when it was done, thus spoke the one:</p>
<p>‘Now let us sit and drink, and be merry,</p>
<p>And afterwards we will his body bury.’</p>
<p>And with those words, he chanced, alas,</p>
<p>To seize a bottle where the poison was,</p>
<p>And drank, and poured his friend a drink too,</p>
<p>So that they died, both of them, the two.  </p>
<p>Surely, I must suppose, Avicenna</p>
<p>In no chapter of his Canon, ever</p>
<p>Wrote of more wondrous signs of poisoning</p>
<p>Than these wretches showed, ere their ending.</p>
<p>Thus died both these homicides, we know,</p>
<p>And then the traitorous poisoner also.</p>
<p>O cursed sin above all cursedness!</p>
<p>O treacherous homicide, O wickedness!</p>
<p>O gluttony, gambling, and lechery!</p>
<p>You blasphemers of Christ, in villainy</p>
<p>Swearing out of habit and of pride!</p>
<p>Alas, mankind, how may this betide,</p>
<p>That to your Creator, He who first wrought</p>
<p>You, and with his precious heart’s blood bought</p>
<p>You again, you’re so false, unkind, alas?</p>
<p>Now good men, God forgive you your trespass,</p>
<p>And shield you from the sin of avarice!</p>
<p>My holy pardon will save you from vice,</p>
<p>So long as you offer up gold and sterling,</p>
<p>Or else silver brooches, spoons and rings.</p>
<p>Bow your head beneath this holy bull.</p>
<p>Come forward wives, make offerings of wool;</p>
<p>Your name I enter here in my roll anon.</p>
<p>Into the bliss of heaven will you be gone;</p>
<p>I absolve you by my sovereign power –</p>
<p>You that offer wool – made pure as the hour</p>
<p>When you were born – And lo, sires, thus I preach.</p>
<p>And Jesus Christ, our healer, our soul’s leech,</p>
<p>May He grant you His pardon to receive,</p>
<p>For that is best, I will not you deceive.</p>
<p>Sires, one thing was forgotten in my tale:</p>
<p>I have relics, pardons in my bale,</p>
<p>As fair as does any man in England,</p>
<p>Which were given me by the Pope’s hand.</p>
<p>If any of you would, out of devotion,</p>
<p>Make offering and have my absolution,</p>
<p>Come forth anon, and kneel you here adown,</p>
<p>And humbly receive my sovereign pardon;</p>
<p>Or else receive it as your way you wend,</p>
<p>All new and fresh at every mile’s end –</p>
<p>As long as you offer, new and new,</p>
<p>Nobles or pence, that are both good and true.</p>
<p>It is an honour to everyone that’s here,</p>
<p>To have found a competent pardoner,</p>
<p>To absolve you, through the country as you ride,</p>
<p>From any accidents that may betide.</p>
<p>Peradventure there may fall one of you</p>
<p>Down from his horse, and break his neck in two.</p>
<p>Look, what a safeguard it is to you all</p>
<p>That I am of your fellowship, on call,</p>
<p>Who can absolve you, the first and last,</p>
<p>When the soul shall from the body pass.</p>
<p>I think that our Host shall first begin,</p>
<p>Since he most enveloped is in sin.</p>
<p>Come forth, Sir Host, and offer up anon,</p>
<p>And you shall kiss the relics, every one,</p>
<p>Yes, for a groat! Unbuckle then your purse.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ quoth he, ‘I’d rather have Christ’s curse!</p>
<p>Let be!’ quoth he, ‘You’ll have not what you seeketh!</p>
<p>You’d have me kissing your old breeches,</p>
<p>And swearing they were a relic, sainted,</p>
<p>Though by your fundament they’re painted.</p>
<p>By Saint Helena’s cross, from Holy Land,</p>
<p>I would I had your bollocks in my hand</p>
<p>Instead of relics or some reliquary!</p>
<p>Have them cut off, them I’ll help you carry</p>
<p>And they shall be enshrined in a hog’s turd!’</p>
<p>The Pardoner answered him not a word;</p>
<p>So wrathful was he, no word could he say.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ quoth our Host, ‘I will no longer play</p>
<p>With you, nor any other angry man.’</p>
<p>But right anon the worthy knight began,</p>
<p>When he saw how all the folk did laugh,</p>
<p>‘No more of this, words enough you’ll have!</p>
<p>Sir Pardoner, be glad and merry of cheer,</p>
<p>And you, Sir Host, who are to me so dear,</p>
<p>I pray you now come kiss the Pardoner.</p>
<p>And Pardoner, I pray you now, draw near,</p>
<p>And as we did before, let’s laugh and play.’</p>
<p>Anon they kissed, and rode forth on their way.</p>

<p>A merchant once there was at Saint-Denis,</p>
<p>Whom men thought wise, for he was wealthy.</p>
<p>A wife he had too, of excellent beauty,</p>
<p>And sociable, and fond of fun was she –</p>
<p>Which is a thing that causes more expense</p>
<p>Than all the close attention and reverence</p>
<p>Is worth, that they receive at feasts and dances.</p>
<p>Such salutations and such countenances</p>
<p>Pass as do the shadows on a wall.</p>
<p>But woe to him then who must pay for all!</p>
<p>The foolish husband always has to pay;</p>
<p>He must clothe us and provide display,</p>
<p>All for his own reputation, richly,</p>
<p>Display amongst which we dance, jollily.</p>
<p>And if he cannot pay, peradventure,</p>
<p>Or else such expense will not endure,</p>
<p>But thinks it wasted, and money lost,</p>
<p>Then must another man pay our cost,</p>
<p>Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.</p>
<p>This noble merchant ran a worthy house,</p>
<p>Because of which such crowds were always there,</p>
<p>For his largess, and since his wife was fair,</p>
<p>It was a wonder; hearken to my tale!</p>
<p>Amongst his guests, the female and the male,</p>
<p>There was a monk, a handsome man and bold –</p>
<p>I guess he was but thirty winters old –</p>
<p>And constantly attracted to the place.</p>
<p>This young monk, who was so fine of face,</p>
<p>Had become so friendly with the husband,</p>
<p>Since their acquaintance first began,</p>
<p>That he was welcomed as familiarly</p>
<p>In his house, as any friend could be.</p>
<p>And inasmuch as this good husband,</p>
<p>And the monk whose tale I just began,</p>
<p>Were both of them born in the same village,</p>
<p>The monk would claim him as a relative,</p>
<p>And he the same; he never said him nay,</p>
<p>But was as glad of it as bird of day,</p>
<p>For to his heart it was sweet circumstance,</p>
<p>That thus they forged eternal alliance,</p>
<p>And each of them the other did assure</p>
<p>Of brotherhood while life should so endure.</p>
<p>Free was monk John, and liberal of expense,</p>
<p>When in that house, and full of diligence</p>
<p>To do what pleases, and so pay his wages.</p>
<p>He never forgot the lowliest of pages,</p>
<p>In all that household, each in his degree</p>
<p>He dowered, the lord and all his company,</p>
<p>Whenever he came, with some generous thing.</p>
<p>So that they were as glad at his arriving</p>
<p>As the birds are when the new sun rises.</p>
<p>No more of that for now, since it suffices.</p>
<p>It so befell, this merchant one fine day</p>
<p>Was readying all his travelling array,</p>
<p>Towards the town of Bruges for to fare,</p>
<p>To buy there a portion of his wares;</p>
<p>And so to Paris he had sent anon</p>
<p>A messenger, requesting of Sir John</p>
<p>That he should come to Saint Denis, and stay</p>
<p>With him and with his wife, beyond a day,</p>
<p>Before he left for Bruges, as he must do.</p>
<p>This noble monk, whom I describe to you,</p>
<p>Won from his abbot, as requested, licence,</p>
<p>Because he was a man of great prudence</p>
<p>An abbey officer, appointed so to ride,</p>
<p>To check the barns and granges, far and wide;</p>
<p>And to Saint Denis came he anon.</p>
<p>Who was as welcome as my lord Sir John,</p>
<p>Our dear cousin, full of courtesy?</p>
<p>With him he brought a jar of fine Malmsey,</p>
<p>Another too, a white, Italian vintage,</p>
<p>And wild-fowl as well, as was his usage.</p>
<p>And so leave them to eat and drink and play,</p>
<p>The merchant and the monk, the livelong day.</p>
<p>On the third day, this merchant rises</p>
<p>And of his duties sadly himself advises,</p>
<p>And up into his counting-house goes he,</p>
<p>To reckon up, himself, as it must be,</p>
<p>How the year had gone with him, and stood,</p>
<p>And how much he’d expended of his goods,</p>
<p>And whether he’d made a profit or made none.</p>
<p>His books, and bags of coin, many a one,</p>
<p>He laid before him on his counting-board.</p>
<p>Full rich was his treasure and his hoard,</p>
<p>And so he kept the counter-door fast shut;</p>
<p>And wished no man to come and interrupt</p>
<p>His casting of the accounts, for some time.</p>
<p>And so he sat there till well after prime.</p>
<p>Sir John had risen in the morn also,</p>
<p>And walked about the garden to and fro,</p>
<p>While making his devotions all devoutly.</p>
<p>The good wife came walking covertly</p>
<p>Into the garden where he wandered softly,</p>
<p>And saluted him, as she had frequently.</p>
<p>A maid child came with her for company,</p>
<p>Whom she might govern as she pleased,</p>
<p>For yet under the rod was the maid.</p>
<p>‘O dear cousin mine, Sir John,’ she said,</p>
<p>‘What ails you, so early do you rise?’</p>
<p>‘Niece,’ quoth he, ‘really it should suffice</p>
<p>For me to sleep five hours of a night,</p>
<p>Except I were some old enfeebled fright,</p>
<p>As are those married men, who cower there,</p>
<p>As in a form might sit a weary hare</p>
<p>Tormented by the hounds in the vale.</p>
<p>But dear niece, why are you so pale?</p>
<p>I might guess, for sure, that our good man</p>
<p>Had laboured with you so, since night began,</p>
<p>That you have need of rest now, and swiftly.’</p>
<p>And with these words he laughed right merrily,</p>
<p>And with his own thoughts he waxed all red.</p>
<p>The fair wife began to shake her head,</p>
<p>And said thus: ‘Ah, God knows all,’ quoth she.</p>
<p>Nay, cousin mine, it stands not so with me!</p>
<p>For, by the God that gave me soul and life,</p>
<p>In all the realm of France there is no wife</p>
<p>That finds less pleasure in that sorry play;</p>
<p>For I may sing “alas!” and “well-away</p>
<p>That I was born!” but to no one’, quoth she</p>
<p>‘Dare I tell how things truly stand with me.</p>
<p>So that I think out of this land to wend,</p>
<p>Or else of my own self to make an end,</p>
<p>So full am I of fear and of care.’</p>
<p>Hearing this, the monk began to stare,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Alas, my niece, God forbid</p>
<p>That you for any sorrow or for dread</p>
<p>Should kill yourself; come, tell me all your grief.</p>
<p>Peradventure I may give you some relief</p>
<p>Or counsel in your trouble, so tell me</p>
<p>All your problems, speak them privately.</p>
<p>For on my breviary I swear an oath,</p>
<p>That never in all my life, to friend or foe,</p>
<p>Any secret of yours shall I betray.’</p>
<p>‘The same again to you,’ quoth she, ‘I say.</p>
<p>By God and by this breviary I swear,</p>
<p>Though men me into pieces all would tear,</p>
<p>That I shall never, may I go to Hell,</p>
<p>Betray a single word to me you tell,</p>
<p>Not for our kinship, no, nor alliance,</p>
<p>But truly out of love and affiance.’</p>
<p>So were they sworn, and thereupon they kissed,</p>
<p>And each told the other what they wished.</p>
<p>‘Cousin,’ quoth she, ‘if that I had a space</p>
<p>Of time – as I have not, here in this place –</p>
<p>Then would I tell the story of my life,</p>
<p>How I have suffered since I was a wife</p>
<p>With my husband, though he is your cousin.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the monk, ‘by God and Saint Martin,</p>
<p>He is no more a cousin unto me</p>
<p>Than is this leaf hanging from the tree!</p>
<p>I call him so, by Saint Denis of France,</p>
<p>To have better reason for acquaintance</p>
<p>With you, whom I love, especially,</p>
<p>Above all women, and so most deeply;</p>
<p>This I swear to you, by my profession.</p>
<p>Tell me your grief, give it full expression,</p>
<p>Lest he come: quick, then go your way anon.’</p>
<p>‘My dear love,’ quoth she, ‘O my Sir John,</p>
<p>It were better this secret for to hide,</p>
<p>But it must out; it may no more abide.</p>
<p>My husband is to me the vilest man</p>
<p>There ever was since the world began!</p>
<p>But since I’m his wife, it befits not me</p>
<p>Ever to compromise our privacy,</p>
<p>Neither in bed nor any other place.</p>
<p>God forbid I should tell, by His grace!</p>
<p>A wife should not speak about her husband</p>
<p>Except in honour, as I well understand.</p>
<p>But to tell you this much, well I shall:</p>
<p>So help me God he is worth naught at all,</p>
<p>Not even, I say, the value of a flea.</p>
<p>But what grieves me most, he’s niggardly!</p>
<p>And you know well, that women naturally</p>
<p>Desire six things, indeed, like to me:</p>
<p>They desire their husbands should be</p>
<p>Brave, wise, and rich, and liberally free,</p>
<p>Obedient to their wives, and fresh in bed.</p>
<p>But by the same Lord that for us bled,</p>
<p>For his honour, to dress in fine array,</p>
<p>On Sunday next it’s necessary I pay</p>
<p>A hundred francs, or else I die forlorn.</p>
<p>Yet it were better I had not been born,</p>
<p>Than be subject to slander or villainy.</p>
<p>And if my husband aught of this should see,</p>
<p>I’d be lost; and therefore you I pray,</p>
<p>Lend me the sum, or I must die today.</p>
<p>Sir John, I say, lend me this hundred francs;</p>
<p>In faith, I will not fail of my thanks,</p>
<p>If that you choose to do what I pray.</p>
<p>For on the date you set I will repay,</p>
<p>And do whatever pleasure and service</p>
<p>I may do you, such as you shall request.</p>
<p>And if I do not, God take on me vengeance,</p>
<p>As foul as that earned by Ganelon of France!’</p>
<p>The noble monk answered in this manner:</p>
<p>‘Now truly, my own lady, and my dear,</p>
<p>I have’ quoth he, ‘such pity for you, my oath</p>
<p>I swear to you, and plight to you my troth</p>
<p>That, when your husband does to Flanders fare,</p>
<p>I will deliver you from all this care,</p>
<p>For I will bring you the hundred francs.’</p>
<p>And with these words he caught her by the flanks,</p>
<p>And embraced her hard, and kissed her fiercely.</p>
<p>‘Go now your way,’ quoth he, still and softly,</p>
<p>‘And let us dine, soon as ever we may,</p>
<p>For by my dial it’s past the prime of day.</p>
<p>Go now, and be as true as I shall be.’</p>
<p>‘God forbid it otherwise, sire,’ quoth she;</p>
<p>And forth she went as pert as a magpie,</p>
<p>And bade the cooks be swift, that by and by</p>
<p>Men might sit and dine, and that anon.</p>
<p>Off to her husband then the wife was gone,</p>
<p>And knocked at his counting-house door boldly.</p>
<p>‘Qui la?’ quoth he. ‘Why, Peter, it is me’</p>
<p>Quoth she; ‘What, sire! How long now must you fast?</p>
<p>How much longer reckon up and cast</p>
<p>Your sums, and all your books and things?</p>
<p>Devil take all such devilish reckonings!</p>
<p>You have enough, in faith, from God’s own hand;</p>
<p>Come down today, and let your coffers stand.</p>
<p>Aren’t you ashamed now that our good Sir John</p>
<p>Is fasting wretchedly all this day gone?</p>
<p>What! Let’s hear a Mass, and go and dine.’</p>
<p>‘Wife,’ quoth the man, ‘little can you divine</p>
<p>The complicated business that we run;</p>
<p>For of us merchants, God save all and one,</p>
<p>And by the lord that is called Saint Ive,</p>
<p>Scarcely two in every twelve may thrive</p>
<p>Continually, and it last to our old age.</p>
<p>We must ever show a cheerful visage,</p>
<p>And seem to take the world as it will be,</p>
<p>And veil our own affairs in secrecy,</p>
<p>Till we are dead, or else we must go play</p>
<p>At pilgrimage, or hide ourselves away,</p>
<p>And therefore it’s a prime necessity</p>
<p>For me to judge this strange world carefully.</p>
<p>For evermore we must live in dread</p>
<p>Of mishap and ill Fortune on our head.</p>
<p>To Flanders shall I go tomorrow day,</p>
<p>And then return as soon as ever I may.</p>
<p>For which reason, wife, I do beseech,</p>
<p>You to all men be courteous and meek,</p>
<p>And, to guard our property, be zealous,</p>
<p>And govern well and honestly our house.</p>
<p>You have enough of all, in ever wise,</p>
<p>That for a thrifty household should suffice.</p>
<p>You lack nothing here in clothes or victuals;</p>
<p>The silver in your purse too shall not fail.’</p>
<p>And with that his counter-door he shut,</p>
<p>And down he went then, with ready foot.</p>
<p>Then and there a Mass was swiftly said,</p>
<p>And speedily the tables all were spread;</p>
<p>And to break their fast they quickly sped;</p>
<p>And sumptuously this monk the merchant fed.</p>
<p>After the dinner, Sir John, soberly,</p>
<p>Took the merchant aside, and privately</p>
<p>Spoke to him thus: ‘Cousin, it stands so,</p>
<p>I see indeed to Bruges you mean to go.</p>
<p>God and Augustine speed you then and guide!</p>
<p>I pray you, be careful, cousin, how you ride;</p>
<p>Govern yourself also, in your meat,</p>
<p>Temperately, especially in this heat.</p>
<p>Between us two need nothing formal fare.</p>
<p>Farewell, cousin, and God shield you from care!</p>
<p>And if there’s anything, by day or night,</p>
<p>That lies within my power and my might,</p>
<p>Which you command of me, in any wise,</p>
<p>It shall be done, just as you shall advise!</p>
<p>One thing, before you go though, indulge me,</p>
<p>I wonder, now, if you might lend me</p>
<p>A hundred francs, for a week, since I</p>
<p>Have certain cattle that I must buy,</p>
<p>To stock a certain farm that is ours –</p>
<p>God help me so, I wish it were yours!</p>
<p>I must not fail to settle on the day,</p>
<p>Not if it were a thousand francs, I say.</p>
<p>But let this thing be hidden from the eye,</p>
<p>For yet tonight these creatures I must buy.</p>
<p>And now farewell, my own cousin dear;</p>
<p>Graunt merci for your loan and good cheer.’</p>
<p>The noble merchant courteously anon</p>
<p>Answered, saying: ‘O cousin mine, Sir John,</p>
<p>Now this is indeed but a small request!</p>
<p>My gold is yours to do as you think best,</p>
<p>And not only my gold but all my wares;</p>
<p>Take what you wish, don’t leave yourself spare!</p>
<p>But one thing more, let me remind you now,</p>
<p>That, with merchants, our money is our plough.</p>
<p>We may have credit while we have a name,</p>
<p>But to lack gold, well that’s another game.</p>
<p>So pay it again when you can with ease;</p>
<p>In every way I can I wish to please.’</p>
<p>The hundred francs he fetches forth anon,</p>
<p>And covertly conveys them to Sir John.</p>
<p>No one in all this world knows of the loan,</p>
<p>Save the merchant and Sir John alone.</p>
<p>They drink and speak, walk a while and play,</p>
<p>Till, to his abbey, Sir John rides away.</p>
<p>The morrow comes, forth does the merchant ride</p>
<p>On Flanders road; his prentice as his guide</p>
<p>Until he reaches Bruges full merrily.</p>
<p>Now goes the merchant fast and busily</p>
<p>About his business, buys, and pays advances.</p>
<p>He neither plays at dice, there, nor dances,</p>
<p>But like a merchant, briefly for to tell,</p>
<p>He leads his life; and there I’ll leave him dwell.</p>
<p>The very next Sunday after he’d gone,</p>
<p>To Saint-Denis returned the good Sir John,</p>
<p>With his beard and tonsure freshly shaved.</p>
<p>In all that household, from the littlest knave</p>
<p>To every other there, the joy was plain</p>
<p>At seeing my lord Sir John back there again.</p>
<p>And swiftly to the point right for to go,</p>
<p>The fair wife settled with Sir John also</p>
<p>That for the hundred francs he should all night</p>
<p>Hold her in his arms tight, till it was light.</p>
<p>And this accord was acted out in deed;</p>
<p>In mirth all night a busy life they lead</p>
<p>Till it is day, Sir John goes on his way,</p>
<p>Bidding the household all: ‘Farewell, good day!’</p>
<p>– For none of them, no person of that town,</p>
<p>Had of good Sir John the least suspicion.</p>
<p>And forth he rode and homeward to his abbey,</p>
<p>Or where he pleased; no more of him from me.</p>
<p>The merchant, when he’d finished his affairs,</p>
<p>To Saint Denis rides off, and there repairs;</p>
<p>And with his wife seeks feasting and good cheer,</p>
<p>Tells her the merchandise has proved so dear,</p>
<p>He must negotiate a fresh advance</p>
<p>For he is bound by a recognisance</p>
<p>To pay down twenty thousand crowns anon.</p>
<p>And so the merchant was to Paris gone,</p>
<p>To borrow from certain friends whom he had,</p>
<p>A sum of francs, to those he took to add.</p>
<p>And when that he was come unto the town,</p>
<p>Out of the love and the great affection</p>
<p>He had for Sir John, he went to him that day –</p>
<p>Not to ask gold of him, or borrow, say,</p>
<p>But to enquire there about his welfare,</p>
<p>And tell him of his merchandise and wares,</p>
<p>As friends do, when their friends are near.</p>
<p>John welcomed him with feast and merry cheer,</p>
<p>And he in turn described, with detailed tally,</p>
<p>What wares he’d bought, most successfully</p>
<p>Thanks be to God, and all fine merchandise;</p>
<p>Save that he must, in some manner of wise,</p>
<p>Obtain a loan, for all was of the best,</p>
<p>And joyfully thus set his mind at rest.</p>
<p>Sir John replied: ‘Well then, I’ll say plain</p>
<p>It’s good that you’re in health, and home again.</p>
<p>And if I were rich, so may I have bliss,</p>
<p>Twenty thousand crowns I’d never miss,</p>
<p>In loans to you, since kindly, the other day,</p>
<p>You lent me gold; and as I can and may</p>
<p>I thank you by God and by Saint James!</p>
<p>Yet nonetheless, I say, I took our dame,</p>
<p>Your wife at home, the same amount again,</p>
<p>Paid on your bench; by certain tokens plain</p>
<p>I could tell you of, she’ll know it well.</p>
<p>Now, by your leave, I may no longer dwell</p>
<p>Upon the matter, our abbot travels anon,</p>
<p>And in his company I must be gone.</p>
<p>Greet our dame for me, my own niece sweet,</p>
<p>And fare thee well, dear cousin, till we meet!’</p>
<p>The merchant, prudent in affairs like this,</p>
<p>Borrowing money, now paid out in Paris</p>
<p>To certain Lombards, placed it in their hands,</p>
<p>The sum of gold, received his bond as planned,</p>
<p>And home he went, merry as a popinjay,</p>
<p>For he knew he must, in the normal way</p>
<p>Of business, turn a more than average</p>
<p>Profit, a thousand francs or so, he’d gage.</p>
<p>His wife was there and met him at the gate,</p>
<p>As she was wont to do, early and late,</p>
<p>And all that night long, in mirth they met,</p>
<p>For he was rich, and free of all his debt.</p>
<p>When it was day, the merchant did embrace</p>
<p>His wife afresh, and then he kissed her face,</p>
<p>At her he went, and played a little rough.</p>
<p>‘No more!’ quoth she, ‘by God, you have enough!’</p>
<p>And wantonly again with him she played,</p>
<p>Till, at the last, thus the merchant said:</p>
<p>‘I’m angered somewhat’ quoth he, ‘by my oath,</p>
<p>With you, my wife, although as ever loth</p>
<p>To criticise. And why? Well, as I guess,</p>
<p>You’ve brought about a kind of awkwardness</p>
<p>Between me and my cousin good Sir John.</p>
<p>You should have warned me, ere I was gone,</p>
<p>That he a hundred francs to you had paid</p>
<p>By ready tokens, and was quite dismayed</p>
<p>When I spoke about a loan to be advanced –</p>
<p>Or so it seemed from his wry countenance.</p>
<p>Yet, nonetheless, by God, our Heavenly King,</p>
<p>I’d had no wish to ask for anything.</p>
<p>I pray you wife, next time do not do so;</p>
<p>Tell me always, ere that from you I go,</p>
<p>Of any debtor who may in my absence</p>
<p>Have paid you, lest by your negligence</p>
<p>I ask him for what he’s already paid.’</p>
<p>The wife was unfazed and unafraid,</p>
<p>And boldly she said, and that anon:</p>
<p>‘Marry, I defy the false monk, Sir John!</p>
<p>I care naught for his tokens. It befell</p>
<p>He gave me certain coins, I know it well –</p>
<p>What then? Evil fall on his monk’s snout! –</p>
<p>For, God knows, I thought, without a doubt,</p>
<p>That they were given to me because of you,</p>
<p>To do me honour, and benefit me too,</p>
<p>From cousinship, and also the good cheer</p>
<p>He has so often had when he was here.</p>
<p>But since it seems the thing is all disjoint,</p>
<p>I’ll answer you briefly now, and to the point.</p>
<p>You’ve many a slacker debtor than me,</p>
<p>For I will pay you well and readily</p>
<p>From day to day; and if so ever I fail,</p>
<p>I am your wife, tally it on my tail,</p>
<p>And I will pay as soon as ever I may.</p>
<p>For, by my oath I have, on fine display,</p>
<p>But not extravagance, as thus befell,</p>
<p>Spent every bit, and spent it all so well</p>
<p>For your honour, that, for God’s sake, I say</p>
<p>Do not be angry, let us laugh and play.</p>
<p>You’ll have my sweet body as pledge instead;</p>
<p>By God, I’ll only pay you thus, in bed!</p>
<p>Forgive me then, my own spouse, my dear;</p>
<p>Turn hitherward, and show better cheer.’</p>
<p>The merchant saw there was no remedy,</p>
<p>And to chide her for it merely folly,</p>
<p>Since the thing could not amended be.</p>
<p>‘Well, wife,’ he said, ‘I forgive it thee;</p>
<p>But by your life, the bills make not so large.</p>
<p>Guard our wealth better; so I you do charge.’</p>
<p>Thus ends my tale now, and may God us send</p>
<p>Tal(ly)ing enough unto our own life’s end! Amen.</p>

<p>‘Well said, by Corpus Dominus!’ quoth our Host.</p>
<p>‘Now, long may you sail about our coast,</p>
<p>Sir gentle master, gentle mariner!</p>
<p>God give the monk a cartload of bad years!</p>
<p>Aha, my friends, be wary of such japes!</p>
<p>In the merchant’s hood our monk loosed an ape,</p>
<p>And in his wife’s too, by Saint Augustine;</p>
<p>Ask no more monks to any house you’re in.</p>
<p>But now, pass on, and let us seek about</p>
<p>For who will next tell, of all this rout,</p>
<p>Another tale’ – and after that he said,</p>
<p>As courteously as if he were a maid:</p>
<p>‘My Lady Prioress, by your leave,</p>
<p>If that I knew it would not truly grieve,</p>
<p>I would judge it fitting that you should</p>
<p>Tell the next tale, if it so be you would.</p>
<p>Now will you agree, my lady dear?’</p>
<p>‘Gladly,’ quoth she, and spoke as you shall hear.</p>


<p>‘O Lord, our Lord, your name how marvellous</p>
<p>It is, far spread in this great world!’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘For not only is your praise, most precious,</p>
<p>Celebrated by men of dignity,</p>
<p>But in the mouths of children your bounty</p>
<p>Is celebrated too; for at the breast sucking</p>
<p>Sometimes they’ll display their thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Wherefore in praise, as best I can or may,</p>
<p>Of Thee and of the white lily flower</p>
<p>Who bore Thee, and is a maid always,</p>
<p>To tell a tale I’ll now turn my labour –</p>
<p>Not that I may thus increase her honour,</p>
<p>For she herself is honour, the fountain</p>
<p>Of worth, next her Son, the soul’s salvation.</p>
<p>O mother-maid, O maiden-mother free!</p>
<p>O bush un-burnt, burning in Moses’ sight,</p>
<p>That drew down in joy from the Deity,</p>
<p>Through your humility, in you to alight,</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost, of whose power, your heart-light,</p>
<p>Was conceived the Father’s Sapience,</p>
<p>Help me to speak, and show you reverence.</p> 
<p>Lady, your worth, and your magnificence,</p>
<p>Your virtue, and your great humility,</p>
<p>No tongue may express, nor no science.</p>
<p>For often lady, ere men pray to thee,</p>
<p>You go before them, in benignity,</p>
<p>And obtain the light for us of prayer</p>
<p>To guide us towards your Son so dear.</p>
<p>My skill’s so weak, O my blissful Queen,</p>
<p>Ever to declare your great worthiness,</p>
<p>That I may not the weight of it sustain,</p>
<p>But like a child but twelve months old or less,</p>
<p>That can scarce a single word express,</p>
<p>So then am I; and therefore I now pray,</p>
<p>Guide my song of you, as on I say.</p>

<p>There was in Asia, in a great city</p>
<p>Of Christian folks, a ghetto for Jewry,</p>
<p>Maintained by a lord of that country,</p>
<p>For shameful profit out of foul usury,</p>
<p>Hateful to Christ and all his company.</p>
<p>And through its streets men might ride and wend,</p>
<p>For it was free, and open at either end.</p>
<p>A little school of Christian folk there stood</p>
<p>Down at the farther end, in which there were</p>
<p>A crowd of children, born of Christian blood,</p>
<p>Who learned in that school, year by year,</p>
<p>Such manner of doctrine as men used there –</p>
<p>That is to say, to sing and then to read,</p>
<p>As little ones when children do, indeed.</p>
<p>Among these children was a widow’s son,</p>
<p>A little schoolboy, seven years of age,</p>
<p>Who day by day off to the school would run,</p>
<p>And also whenever he saw the image</p>
<p>Of Christ’s mother, as was common usage</p>
<p>And taught to him, would kneel down and say</p>
<p>His Ave Maria, as he passed by the way.</p>
<p>Thus had the widow her small son taught</p>
<p>Our blissful lady, Christ’s mother dear,</p>
<p>To worship ever; and he’d forgotten naught,</p>
<p>For innocent children are quick to hear</p>
<p>Such things. And I remember in this matter,</p>
<p>Saint Nicholas, who is ever in my presence,</p>
<p>Who though young showed Christ due reverence.</p> 
<p>This little child, his little book studying,</p>
<p>As he sat in school over his primer,</p>
<p>Alma redemptoris heard others singing,</p>
<p>Learning the antiphon from their reader;</p>
<p>And close as he dared he drew near and nearer,</p>
<p>And harkened to the word and the notes,</p>
<p>Till he had learnt the first verse by rote.</p>
<p>He’d no grasp of what the Latin might say,</p>
<p>Being so young, and of so tender an age;</p>
<p>But one morning he asked a friend, if, pray,</p>
<p>He might expound the song in his language,</p>
<p>And tell him why it was in common usage.</p>
<p>He begged him to construe it and declare</p>
<p>Its meaning, often down on his knees bare.</p>
<p>His friend, who was older than was he,</p>
<p>Answered him thus: ‘This song, I have heard say,</p>
<p>Was made about our blissful Lady free,</p>
<p>To salute her, and also to her pray</p>
<p>To be our help and succour always.</p>
<p>I can expound no further of this matter;</p>
<p>I know the song; but have no grasp of grammar.’</p>
<p>‘And is this song made in reverence</p>
<p>Of Christ’s mother?’ asked the innocent.</p>
<p>‘Then I’ll employ all my diligence</p>
<p>To learn it all ere Christmastide is spent,</p>
<p>Though from my primer I must be rent,</p>
<p>And shall be beaten thrice in an hour,</p>
<p>I will learn it, Our Lady for to honour.’</p> 
<p>His friend taught him it privately</p>
<p>Each day as they went home, till by rote</p>
<p>He knew it, then sang it well and boldly,</p>
<p>Every word, according to the notes.</p>
<p>Twice a day it passed through his throat,</p>
<p>School-ward and homeward as he went;</p>
<p>On Christ’s mother set was his intent.</p>
<p>As I have said, among the Jewry,</p>
<p>This little child, as he went to and fro,</p>
<p>Full merrily then would he sing and cry</p>
<p>‘O alma redemptoris’ and ever so.</p>
<p>The sweetness had pierced his heart, lo,</p>
<p>Of Christ’s mother, so that he must pray</p>
<p>To her, nor leave off singing by the way.</p>
<p>Our first foe, Serpent Satan, who has</p>
<p>Made in the Jew’s heart his wasp’s nest,</p>
<p>Swelled up and said, ‘O Hebrew folk, alas!</p>
<p>Is this a thing that seems to you full honest,</p>
<p>That such a boy shall walk by, as if blessed,</p>
<p>In spite of you, and sing out each sentence</p>
<p>That goes against the laws you reverence?’</p>
<p>From thenceforth the Jews there conspired</p>
<p>The innocent from out this world to chase.</p>
<p>A murderer, to serve this end, they hired,</p>
<p>Who in an alley had a private place,</p>
<p>And as the child passed by at a pace,</p>
<p>This wretched Jew caught and held him fast,</p>
<p>And cut his throat, and in the pit him cast.</p> 
<p>Into a privy-drain him they threw,</p>
<p>Where the Jews purged their entrails.</p>
<p>O cursed folk of Herod, born anew,</p>
<p>How shall your evil intent you avail?</p>
<p>Murder will out, for sure, and shall not fail</p>
<p>God’s honour, there, especially for to speed,</p>
<p>The blood cries out against your cursed deed.</p>
<p>O Martyr, bonded to virginity,</p>
<p>Now you may sing, ever following on</p>
<p>The white Lamb celestial – quoth she –</p>
<p>Of which the great evangelist, Saint John</p>
<p>Of Patmos, wrote, who says those who are gone</p>
<p>Sing before the Lamb a song all new,</p>
<p>Who never, in the flesh, women knew.</p>
<p>The poor widow waited all that night</p>
<p>For her little child, but he came not.</p>
<p>So, as soon as ever it was light,</p>
<p>Her face pale with dread, in anxious thought,</p>
<p>She, at the school and elsewhere, him sought;</p>
<p>Till this much she discovered, finally,</p>
<p>That he had last been seen among the Jewry.</p>
<p>With mother’s pity in her breast enclosed,</p>
<p>She went, and she was half out of her mind,</p>
<p>To every place where she might suppose</p>
<p>It likely that she might her child find;</p>
<p>And ever on Christ’s mother, meek and kind,</p>
<p>She cried, and at the last thus she wrought:</p>
<p>Among the cursed Jews she him sought.</p> 
<p>She begged, and she prayed piteously</p>
<p>Of every Jew who dwelt in that place,</p>
<p>To tell her if her child had been by.</p>
<p>They said ‘nay’ but Jesus, of His grace,</p>
<p>Put in her mind, within a little space,</p>
<p>To go from that place, where she cried,</p>
<p>To where he was, in the pit, cast aside.</p>
<p>O Great God, that hears Your praise performed</p>
<p>Through innocent mouths, lo, here is Your might!</p>
<p>This gem of chastity, this emerald,</p>
<p>And of martyrdom this ruby bright,</p>
<p>Lay there with his throat cut, upright,</p>
<p>And Alma redemptoris did he sing</p>
<p>So loud that all the place began to ring.</p>
<p>The Christian folk who through the streets went</p>
<p>Came crowding for wonder at this thing,</p>
<p>And swiftly for the provost then they sent.</p>
<p>He came anon, without tarrying,</p>
<p>While praising Christ, who is of Heaven king,</p>
<p>His mother also, honour of mankind,</p>
<p>And after that the wretched Jews did bind.</p>
<p>The child, with piteous lamentation</p>
<p>Was lifted up, singing his song always;</p>
<p>And with honour in a great procession</p>
<p>Carried to the abbey ere close of day.</p>
<p>His mother, swooning, by his bier lay;</p>
<p>Scarcely could the people with a tear</p>
<p>Drag this second Rachel from his bier.</p> 
<p>With torment and shameful death each one</p>
<p>The Provost sentence on the Jews did serve</p>
<p>Who of the murder knew, and that anon.</p>
<p>Death for such wickedness he must observe.</p>
<p>Evil shall have what evil does deserve;</p>
<p>So with wild horses he did them draw,</p>
<p>And hung them then, according to the law.</p>
<p>Upon his bier still lay this innocent,</p>
<p>Before the altar while the Mass did last,</p>
<p>And after that the Abbot with his convent,</p>
<p>Hastened them to bury him full fast.</p>
<p>And when they holy water on him cast,</p>
<p>The child spoke, sprinkled with the water,</p>
<p>And sang: ‘O alma redemptis mater’.</p>
<p>The abbot then, who was a holy man,</p>
<p>As monks are – or else they ought to be –</p>
<p>The little child to beseech began,</p>
<p>Saying: ‘O, dear child, I entreat thee,</p>
<p>By virtue of the Holy Trinity,</p>
<p>Tell me what allows you thus to sing,</p>
<p>Since your throat is cut, as seems the thing?’</p>
<p>‘My throat is cut through to the neck-bone,’</p>
<p>Said the child, ‘in the manner of mankind,</p>
<p>I should have died – and long ago be gone.</p>
<p>But Jesus Christ, as you in books will find,</p>
<p>Wills that His glory last, be kept in mind;</p>
<p>And for the worship of his mother dear,</p>
<p>I may yet sing “O alma” loud and clear.</p> 
<p>That well of mercy, Christ’s mother sweet,</p>
<p>I have loved always, after my knowing;</p>
<p>And when my death I was about to meet,</p>
<p>She came to me, and bade me for to sing</p>
<p>This anthem in truth while I was dying,</p>
<p>As you have heard; and when I had sung</p>
<p>She laid a grain of seed upon my tongue.</p>
<p>And so I sing, and sing I must again,</p>
<p>In honour of that blissful maiden free,</p>
<p>Till from my tongue is removed that grain.</p>
<p>And after that, thus she spoke to me:</p>
<p>“My little child, I will come to fetch thee</p>
<p>When that the grain from your tongue they take.</p>
<p>Be not afraid; I will not thee forsake.”’</p>
<p>The holy monk – the abbot, I mean he –</p>
<p>Touched his tongue, and so removed the grain,</p>
<p>And thus he gave up the ghost full softly.</p>
<p>And when the abbot saw this wonder plain,</p>
<p>His salt tears trickled down like rain,</p>
<p>And down he fell flat upon the ground,</p>
<p>And still he lay, as if he had been bound.</p>
<p>The convent of monks lay on the pavement</p>
<p>Weeping, praising Christ’s mother dear.</p>
<p>And after that they rose, and forth they went,</p>
<p>And took up the martyr from his bier.</p>
<p>And in a tomb of marble polished sheer</p>
<p>They enclosed his little body sweet.</p>
<p>There he is now, God grant we may meet!</p> 
<p>O young Hugh of Lincoln, slain also</p>
<p>By cursed Jews, a tale still notable,</p>
<p>Since it was but a little while ago,</p>
<p>Pray for us too, we folk to sin so liable,</p>
<p>That, in His mercy, God all merciful</p>
<p>Grant us great mercy, and never vary,</p>
<p>In reverence for his mother Mary. Amen.</p>

<p>When told was all this miracle, every man</p>
<p>Was sobered so, it was a sight to see;</p>
<p>Until our Host to jest again began,</p>
<p>And for the first time now he looked at me,</p>
<p>And ‘What manner of man are you,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘You look as though you seek to start a hare,</p>
<p>For ever on the ground I see you stare.</p>
<p>Come nearer, and look up now merrily!</p>
<p>Attend, sires, and find this man a place!</p>
<p>He in the waist is formed as well as me;</p>
<p>This were a poppet now in her embrace</p>
<p>For any woman small and fair of face!</p>
<p>He seems elvish by his countenance,</p>
<p>For with no one does he make dalliance.</p>
<p>Speak somewhat now, since other folks have said;</p>
<p>Tell us a tale of mirth, and that anon!’</p>
<p>‘Host,’ quoth I, ‘may you be not dismayed:</p>
<p>Of other tales, I’m certain, I know none,</p>
<p>Only a rhyme I learned, in times long gone.’</p>
<p>‘Well, that is fine,’ quoth he, ‘now we shall hear</p>
<p>Some dainty thing, by your face, it would appear.’</p> 

<p>Listen lords, with good intent,</p>
<p>And I will tell, all truly meant,</p>
<p>Of mirth and of solace,</p>
<p>All of a knight fair and pleasant</p>
<p>In battle and in tournament;</p>
<p>His name was Sir Topaz.</p>
<p>Born was he in a far country,</p>
<p>In Flanders, all beyond the sea,</p>
<p>Poperinge was the place.</p>
<p>His father was a man full free,</p>
<p>And lord he was of that country,</p>
<p>By God’s eternal grace.</p>
<p>Sir Topaz was a doughty swain;</p>
<p>White was his face as flour again,</p>
<p>His lips red as the rose.</p>
<p>And his complexion showed a stain,</p>
<p>Of scarlet red, and I’d maintain</p>
<p>He had a seemly nose.</p>
<p>His hair was, as his beard, saffron,</p>
<p>And to his girdle tumbled down;</p>
<p>His shoes Cordovan plain.</p>
<p>Of Bruges was his hose rich brown;</p>
<p>His robe of silken fabric found,</p>
<p>That cost as much again.</p>  
<p>He was skilled at hunting deer,</p>
<p>And hawking wildfowl on the mere</p>
<p>With grey goshawk on hand.</p>
<p>And a good archer, never fear;</p>
<p>At wrestling no man was his peer,</p>
<p>When any prize might stand.</p>
<p>Full many a maiden bright in bower,</p>
<p>Pined for him, hour after hour,</p>
<p>That should have been asleep.</p>
<p>But he was chaste, beyond their power,</p>
<p>And sweet as is the bramble-flower</p>
<p>From which the red hips peep.</p>
<p>And it befell, upon a day,</p>
<p>Truthfully, as I truly say,</p>
<p>Sir Topaz took a ride.</p>
<p>He mounted on his steed, a grey,</p>
<p>And in his hand his lance at play,</p>
<p>A long sword by his side.</p>
<p>He spurred through a pleasant forest,</p>
<p>In which lurked there many a beast –</p>
<p>Yea, both buck and hare.</p>
<p>And as he spurred to north and east,</p>
<p>His luck, I tell you, almost ceased</p>
<p>And fate brought sorry care.</p>
<p>There, herbs were springing in the vale,</p>
<p>The liquorice and ginger pale,</p>
<p>And many a clove its offer,</p>
<p>And nutmeg, to improve the ale,</p>
<p>No matter whether fresh or stale,</p>
<p>Or to lay up in coffer.</p>  
<p>There all the birds did sing away,</p>
<p>The sparrow-hawk and popinjay,</p>
<p>A joy it was to hear.</p>
<p>The throstle warbled out his lay;</p>
<p>The wood-pigeon on the spray,</p>
<p>She sang full loud and clear.</p>
<p>Sir Topaz fell in love-longing,</p>
<p>Whenever he heard the throstle sing,</p>
<p>Galloped fast as he could.</p>
<p>His fair steed with all his pricking,</p>
<p>Sweated till his flanks were wringing;</p>
<p>His sides were wet with blood.</p>
<p>Sir Topaz then so weary was</p>
<p>From galloping upon soft grass,</p>
<p>So fierce was his courage,</p>
<p>That down he laid him there, alas,</p>
<p>To give his charger some solace,</p>
<p>Where there was good forage.</p>
<p>‘O Saint Mary, benedicitee!</p>
<p>Why is love then so against me</p>
<p>And binds me now so sore?</p>
<p>I dreamed all this night, pardee,</p>
<p>An Elf-Queen shall my lover be,</p>
<p>Stay by me evermore.</p>
<p>An Elf-Queen will I love, like this,</p>
<p>For in this world no woman is</p>
<p>Worthy my mate to make,</p>
<p class="indent-2">In town.</p>
<p>All other women I forsake,</p>
<p>And an Elf-Queen to me shall take,</p>
<p>By dale and by down.’</p>  
<p>Into his saddle he climbed anon,</p>
<p>And over stile and stone is gone,</p>
<p>An Elf-Queen for to see;</p>
<p>Till he so long has ridden on</p>
<p>That to a secret place he’s won</p>
<p>The country of Faerie</p>
<p class="indent-2">So wild.</p>
<p>For in that country was there none</p>
<p>That dared to ride to him or come,</p>
<p>Neither wife nor child.</p>
<p>Till there arrived a mighty giant;</p>
<p>His name it was Sir Oliphant,</p>
<p>A perilous man indeed.</p>
<p>He said, ‘Child, by Termagant,</p>
<p>If you be not gone from my haunt,</p>
<p>Anon I slay your steed</p>
<p class="indent-2">With mace.</p>
<p>Here there is the Queen of Faery,</p>
<p>With harp and pipe and hurdy-gurdy,</p>
<p>Dwelling in this place.’</p>
<p>The Knight said: ‘May it prosper me,</p>
<p>For tomorrow I’ll meet with thee,</p>
<p>When I have my armour.</p>
<p>And yet I hope, par ma fay,</p>
<p>That with this lance I here display</p>
<p>You’ll pay for it full sore.</p>
<p class="indent-2">Your maw</p>
<p>I will pierce, and if I may,</p>
<p>Ere it be full prime of day,</p>
<p>Here you will breathe no more.’</p>  
<p>Sir Topaz galloped off full fast;</p>
<p>The giant at him stones did cast,</p>
<p>Out of a deadly sling.</p>
<p>But fair escaped this Child Topaz,</p>
<p>Though through God’s grace it was,</p>
<p>And his noble bearing.</p>

<p>Now listen, lordings, to my tale;</p>
<p>Merrier than the nightingale,</p>
<p>Whisperings I will sound,</p>
<p>How Sir Topaz, slim and pale,</p>
<p>Pricking over hill and dale</p>
<p>Is come again to town.</p>
<p>His merry men commanded he</p>
<p>To cheer him there with games and glee,</p>
<p>For he must needs go fight</p>
<p>A giant with dreadful heads three,</p>
<p>For love, and as a votary</p>
<p>Of one that shone full bright.</p>
<p>‘Come, music now that never fails,</p>
<p>And jesters too to tell their tales,</p>
<p>While I am here arming,</p>
<p>Of romances in hidden vales,</p>
<p>Of popes and of cardinals,</p>
<p>And of love and liking.’</p>
<p>They fetch him first the sweet wine,</p>
<p>And in a maple-bowl combine</p>
<p>With royal spicery</p>
<p>Gingerbread that is full fine,</p>
<p>And liquorice, and cumin: vine</p>
<p>And all that’s sugary.</p>  
<p>Next his white flesh did appear</p>
<p>Good linen cloth, both fine and sheer,</p>
<p>Breeches and a shirt.</p>
<p>A jacket next the shirt so frail,</p>
<p>And over that a coat of mail,</p>
<p>For fear of piercing hurt.</p>
<p>And over that a fine hauberk,</p>
<p>All wrought close, of Jewish work,</p>
<p>Full strong it was of plate.</p>
<p>And over that his coat-armour,</p>
<p>As white as is the lily flower,</p>
<p>To show his warlike state.</p>
<p>His shield was all of gold so red,</p>
<p>And thereon was a boar’s head,</p>
<p>A carbuncle beside.</p>
<p>And there he swore on ale and bread,</p>
<p>How that the giant would be dead,</p>
<p>Betide what might betide!</p>
<p>His leg-pieces were leather each,</p>
<p>His sword’s sheath was of ivory,</p>
<p>His helm of brass, all bright;</p>
<p>His saddle too in ivory done,</p>
<p>His bridle as the sun it shone,</p>
<p>Or as the full moon’s light.</p>  
<p>His spear it was of good cypress,</p>
<p>That spoke of war and not of peace,</p>
<p>The head full sharply ground.</p>
<p>His steed it was a dapple grey;</p>
<p>It ambled gently on the way,</p>
<p>Full softly, all around,</p>
<p class="indent-2">In hand.</p>
<p>Lo, lordings mine, here is a fit!</p>
<p>If you would any more of it,</p>
<p>I’ll tell if it I can.</p> 

<p>Now hold your tongues, par charitee,</p>
<p>Both you sir knight, and lady free,</p>
<p>And hearken to my spell,</p>
<p>Of battle and of chivalry,</p>
<p>And wooing too of a lady,</p>
<p>Anon, I will you tell.</p>
<p>Men speak of romances like this,</p>
<p>Of Horn Child, and of Ipotis,</p>
<p>Of Bevis and Sir Guy,</p>
<p>Of Libeus and Pleindamour –</p>
<p>But Sir Topaz, he was the flower</p>
<p>Of royal chivalry!</p>
<p>His charger fine he now bestrode,</p>
<p>And forth upon his way he glowed,</p>
<p>Like sparks from out the flame.</p>
<p>Upon his crest he had a tower,</p>
<p>And stuck therein a lily flower;</p>
<p>God shield his arm from shame!</p>
<p>And since he was a knight errant,</p>
<p>He stayed not in a house, but went</p>
<p>To sleep, wrapped in his hood.</p>
<p>His helmet bright was his pillow,</p>
<p>His warhorse fed, as you will know,</p>
<p>On herbs both fine and good.</p>
<p>He drank water from the well,</p>
<p>As did the knight Sir Perceval,</p>
<p>So worthy neath his coat.</p>
<p>Till on a day –</p> 

<p>‘No more of this, for God’s great dignity!’</p>
<p>Quoth our Host now, ‘since you weary me</p>
<p>With all your tiresome arrant foolishness,</p>
<p>And also, in truth, and God my soul bless,</p>
<p>My ears are aching with your paltry speech!</p>
<p>Rhymes like that the devil himself must teach!</p>
<p>That must be what’s called doggerel,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘Why so,’ quoth I, ‘Why then hinder me</p>
<p>More in my tale then any other man? –</p>
<p>Since I give you the best rhyme that I can.’</p>
<p>‘By God,’ quoth he, ‘said plainly, in a word,</p>
<p>Your idle rhyming isn’t worth a turd!</p>
<p>You do nothing else but waste our time.</p>
<p>Sire, in a word, you shall no longer rhyme.</p>
<p>Try some heroic tale, let me suggest,</p>
<p>Or tell something in prose, if that were best,</p>
<p>In which there is some mirth or some doctrine.’</p>
<p>‘Gladly,’ quoth I, then, ‘by God’s sweet pain!</p>
<p>I shall tell you a little thing in prose,</p>
<p>That you may like, or so I would suppose,</p>
<p>Or else, indeed, you’re too fastidious.</p>
<p>It is a moral tale and virtuous,</p>
<p>Although it’s told sometimes in disguise</p>
<p>By sundry folk, as you may realise.</p>
<p>For as you know each Evangelist writes</p>
<p>In telling of the pain of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>Something different than his fellow does;</p>
<p>And yet his substance is as true for us,</p>
<p>All agree in their essential substance,</p>
<p>Although in telling they reveal a difference.</p>
<p>For some of them say more and some say less,</p>
<p>When they his piteous Passion do express –</p>
<p>I mean by ‘they’, Mark, Matthew, Luke and John –</p>
<p>And yet the substance of their words is one.</p>
<p>Therefore, lordings all, I you beseech,</p>
<p>If the tale, you think, I vary in my speech –</p>
<p>Thus: though I employ a quantity more</p>
<p>Of proverbs than you have heard before</p>
<p>Included in this little treatise here,</p>
<p>To strengthen the effect of my matter –</p>
<p>And though the words are different I say</p>
<p>Than those you’ve heard, yet to you all I pray</p>
<p>Blame me not; for as concerns my substance,</p>
<p>You shall nowhere find any difference</p>
<p>From the substance of the treatise I cite,</p>
<p>After which this merry tale I indite.</p>
<p>And therefore, hearken well to what I say,</p>
<p>And let me tell all of my tale, I pray.’</p> 

<p>When ended was my tale of Melibee</p>
<p>And of Prudence and her benignity,</p>
<p>Our Host said: ‘As a true Christian,</p>
<p>And by the precious corpus Madrian,</p>
<p>I’d rather my wife had heard this tale</p>
<p>Dear God, than have a barrelful of ale!</p>
<p>For she has never shown such patience</p>
<p>As did this Melibeus’ wife Prudence.</p>
<p>By God’s bones, when I beat my knaves,</p>
<p>She brings me the great knobbed staves,</p>
<p>And cries out: “Slay the dogs, every one,</p>
<p>And break their backs and every bone!”</p>
<p>And if there’s any neighbour of mine</p>
<p>Who fails in church his head to incline,</p>
<p>Or is so bold as to commit trespass,</p>
<p>When she comes home she rages in my face,</p>
<p>And shouts: “False coward, avenge your wife!</p>
<p>By corpus bones, I’ll go wield your knife,</p>
<p>And you shall have my distaff and go spin!”</p>
<p>Day and night that’s how she’ll first begin.</p>
<p>“Alas!” she’ll say, ‘that ever it was my fate</p>
<p>To wed a milksop, and a cowardly ape</p>
<p>Who sees himself outfaced, who never fights,</p>
<p>And daren’t stand up, to honour his wife’s rights!”</p>
<p>Such is my life, unless I choose to fight,</p>
<p>And out at door anon I must go, alright,</p>
<p>Or else I am but lost, I must bear me</p>
<p>Like a wild lion, and as foolhardily.</p>
<p>I expect some day she’ll make me slay</p>
<p>A neighbour, and then I’ll be on my way,</p>
<p>For I am dangerous with knife in hand,</p>
<p>Albeit that I dare not her withstand,</p>
<p>For she can heft an arm, by my faith;</p>
<p>As he’ll find out who minds not what he sayeth!</p>
<p>– But let us pass on now from all this matter.</p>
<p>My lord the Monk,’ quoth he, ‘be merry of cheer,</p>
<p>For you shall tell a tale, by my eye.</p>
<p>Lo, Rochester is here, the town fast by!</p>
<p>Ride forth, my lord, don’t break off the game.</p>
<p>Yet, by my troth, I know not your true name;</p>
<p>Whether I should call you my lord Sir John,</p>
<p>Or Sir Thomas now, or else Sir Alban?</p>
<p>Of what house are you, by your father’s kin?</p>
<p>I swear to God you have a full fair skin!</p>
<p>They’ll be gentle pastures to which you post;</p>
<p>You look not like a penitent or ghost.</p>
<p>Upon my faith, you are some officer,</p>
<p>Some worthy sexton, or some cellarer.</p>
<p>And by my father’s soul, I’ll have it known,</p>
<p>You’ll be the master when you are at home –</p>
<p>No poor cloister-dweller, nor a novice,</p>
<p>But an official, a wily man and wise,</p>
<p>And, at that, not short of brawn and bone,</p>
<p>A fine looking person I must own.</p>
<p>I pray God, bring that man confusion</p>
<p>Who first taught you to seek religion!</p>
<p>You would have trodden the hens all right;</p>
<p>Had you licence as you have the might</p>
<p>To satisfy the need that is in nature,</p>
<p>You’d have begotten many a fine creature.</p>
<p>Alas, who draped you in so broad a cope?</p>
<p>God give me sorrow, but if I were Pope,</p>
<p>Not only you, but every mighty man,</p>
<p>Though he were tonsured when he first began,</p>
<p>Should have a wife: for all the world’s forlorn!</p>
<p>Religion’s cornered the market, all the corn</p>
<p>Of treading, and we laymen are but shrimps.</p>
<p>From feeble trees there come but wretched imps;</p>
<p>This makes our heirs, so feeble, so tender,</p>
<p>That feebleness they can scarce engender.</p>
<p>That is what prompts our wives to make assay</p>
<p>Of you religious folk, who can better pay</p>
<p>The debts that are due Venus than may we.</p>
<p>God knows, in no base coinage pay ye!</p>
<p>But be not wrath, my lord, this is but play;</p>
<p>Full oft there’s truth in jest, so I’ve heard say.’</p>
<p>The worthy Monk heard all with patience,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I will with all due diligence,</p>
<p>As far as may conform with decency,</p>
<p>Tell you a tale now, or two or three.</p>
<p>And if you care to hearken, hitherward,</p>
<p>I’ll tell you of the life of Saint Edward –</p>
<p>Or else, first, of some tragedy I’ll tell,</p>
<p>Of which I have a hundred in my cell.</p>
<p>“Tragedy” is to say a kind of story,</p>
<p>Of which old books present the memory,</p>
<p>Of those who stood in great prosperity,</p>
<p>And fell then sadly from a high degree</p>
<p>Into misery, ending wretchedly.</p>
<p>And such are versified most commonly</p>
<p>With six feet, in hexameters are done,</p>
<p>In prose too is written many a one,</p>
<p>And other metres: many a sundry wise.</p>
<p>Lo, this explanation should suffice.</p>
<p>Now hearken, if you wish for to hear!</p>
<p>But first I beseech in this matter, here,</p>
<p>If I should chance to speak of these things,</p>
<p>Whether of popes, emperors, or kings,</p>
<p>Out of the written order, that men find,</p>
<p>Telling some before and some behind,</p>
<p>As first they come to my remembrance,</p>
<p>Accept my excuses for my ignorance.’</p>

<p>I will bewail, in style of tragedy,</p>
<p>The fall of those who stood in high degree,</p>
<p>And fell such that there was no remedy</p>
<p>To raise them out of their adversity.</p>
<p>For when Fortune chooses us to flee,</p>
<p>There is no man her course can stay, I hold.</p>
<p>Let no man blindly trust prosperity!</p>
<p>Be warned by these examples true and old.</p>

<p>With Lucifer, though he an angel were,</p>
<p>And not a man, with him I shall begin;</p>
<p>For though Fortune no angel can impair,</p>
<p>From high degree yet fell he, for his sin,</p>
<p>Down into Hell, and he is still therein,</p>
<p>O Lucifer, brightest of angels all,</p>
<p>Now you are Satan, and may never win</p>
<p>Out of the misery that was your fall!</p>

<p>Lo, Adam in the field, Damascene,</p>
<p>With God’s own finger wrought was he,</p>
<p>And not begot of man’s sperm unclean,</p>
<p>And ruled all Paradise, save for one tree.</p>
<p>Never had worldly man such high degree</p>
<p>As Adam, till through his bad governance</p>
<p>He was driven from his prosperity</p>
<p>To labour, and to Hell, and to mischance.</p>

<p>Lo, Samson, his birth annunciated</p>
<p>By the angel, long ere his nativity,</p>
<p>Was to Almighty God consecrated,</p>
<p>And stood forth nobly while he could see:</p>
<p>There was never another such as he,</p>
<p>As regards his strength, and hardiness.</p>
<p>But to his wives his secret told he,</p>
<p>And so he slew himself from wretchedness.</p>

<p>Samson, this noble all-conquering champion,</p>
<p>Without weapon save his hands, I say,</p>
<p>Slew, and then rent to pieces, a lion,</p>
<p>While walking to his wedding, by the way.</p>
<p>His wife would please him so, and pray</p>
<p>Till she his counsel knew; and she untrue</p>
<p>Unto his foes his counsel did betray,</p>
<p>And forsook him, and took another new.</p>

<p>Three hundred foxes Samson took, in ire,</p>
<p>And all their tails he tied up in a band,</p>
<p>And set the foxes’ tails all on fire,</p>
<p>For he to every tail attached a brand;</p>
<p>And they burned all the corn in the land,</p>
<p>And all the olive-trees, and vines also.</p>
<p>A thousand men he slew with his hand,</p>
<p>With nothing but an ass’s jaw-bone.</p>

<p>When they were dead, so thirsted him that he</p>
<p>Was near to death himself, and then did pray</p>
<p>That God would on his pain now take pity</p>
<p>And send him drink, or he must die that day.</p>
<p>And from the ass’s jaw-bone, dry, I say,</p>
<p>Out of a back tooth, sprang anon a well,</p>
<p>Of which he drank enough, and was saved.</p>
<p>Thus God helped him, as Judges will tell.</p>
<p>By strength alone, at Gaza, then, one night,</p>
<p>Despite the Philistines in that city,</p>
<p>The town gates he tore up, in his might,</p>
<p>And carried them on his back, did he,</p>
<p>To a high hill, so anyone might see.</p>
<p>O noble all-conquering Samson, loved and dear,</p>
<p>Had you not told your secret, privately,</p>
<p>In all this world you would have had no peer!</p>

<p>Samson, he never cider drank nor wine,</p>
<p>Nor to his hair came shears or razor there,</p>
<p>By precept of the messenger divine,</p>
<p>For all of his great strength lay in his hair.</p>
<p>And fully twenty winters, year by year,</p>
<p>He had of Israel the governance.</p>
<p>But soon he had to weep many a tear,</p>
<p>For woman would bring him to mischance.</p>

<p>To Delilah, his lover, thus he told</p>
<p>How in his hair all his great strength lay,</p>
<p>And falsely to his foes she him sold;</p>
<p>And sleeping in a barn there, on a day,</p>
<p>She clipped and sheared his hair away,</p>
<p>And let his enemies all this trick espy.</p>
<p>And when he was weakened in this way,</p>
<p>They bound him fast, and quenched each eye.</p>

<p>And ere she did his hair both clip and shave,</p>
<p>There was no bond with which men might him bind.</p>
<p>Yet once he was imprisoned in a cave</p>
<p>They made him labour at the quern and grind.</p>
<p>O noble Samson, strongest of mankind,</p>
<p>O sometime Judge, in glory and in richness!</p>
<p>Now may you weep with eyes stone blind,</p>
<p>Since you are fallen to such wretchedness.</p>
<p>The end of this poor wretch was as I say:</p>
<p>His enemies made a feast, one fine day,</p>
<p>And made him as their fool before them play;</p>
<p>And this was in a temple, with great display.</p>
<p>But at the last, he made a fierce affray,</p>
<p>For two pillars he shook and made them fall;</p>
<p>And down fell temple and all, and there it lay,</p>
<p>And he slew himself and his enemies all.</p>

<p>That is, the Magistrates every one,</p>
<p>Three thousand others too, were there slain</p>
<p>Buried beneath the great temple of stone.</p>
<p>Of Samson’s tale no more will I explain.</p>
<p>Be warned by this example old and plain</p>
<p>That none should tell his secrets to his wife,</p>
<p>Such things that he’d in secrecy retain,</p>
<p>Touching the safety of his limbs and life.</p>

<p>Of Hercules, the sovereign conqueror,</p>
<p>His works sing his praise and high renown,</p>
<p>For, in his time, of strength he was the flower.</p>
<p>He slew and took the skin from the lion;</p>
<p>The Centaurs’ vaunted pride he brought down.</p>
<p>The Harpies he slew, those cruel birds fell;</p>
<p>He stole the golden apples from the dragon;</p>
<p>And dragged Cerberus the hound from Hell.</p>
<p>He slew the tyrant, Diomede the vicious,</p>
<p>And made his horses eat him, flesh and bone;</p>
<p>He slew the fiery serpent venomous;</p>
<p>Of Achelous’ two horns he broke one,</p>
<p>And he slew Cacus in his cave of stone;</p>
<p>He slew the giant Antaeus the strong;</p>
<p>He slew the grisly boar, and that anon,</p>
<p>And bore the heavens, on his neck, long.</p>

<p>Was never hero since the world began,</p>
<p>Who slew as many monsters as did he.</p>
<p>Through the whole wide world his name ran,</p>
<p>For both his strength and his great bounty,</p>
<p>And every realm he travelled for to see;</p>
<p>He was so strong no man might him fret.</p>
<p>At both the world’s ends, says Trophee,</p>
<p>Instead of boundaries he a pillar set.</p>

<p>A lover had this noble champion,</p>
<p>She was Deianira, fresh as May;</p>
<p>And, as the scholars make mention,</p>
<p>She sent him a shirt, fresh and gay.</p>
<p>Alas! This shirt – alas, and well away! –</p>
<p>Envenomed was so subtly withal</p>
<p>That ere he had worn it half a day,</p>
<p>It made his flesh all from his bones fall.</p>

<p>But nonetheless, some writers make excuse</p>
<p>For her, saying it was Nessus’ shirt in fact.</p>
<p>That being the case, I shall not her accuse;</p>
<p>But he wore this shirt on his naked back,</p>
<p>Till his flesh from the venom was all black.</p>
<p>And when he found no other remedy nigh,</p>
<p>On hot coals he lay down, since on the rack</p>
<p>Of venomous torment he scorned to die.</p>
<p>Thus fell the mighty, noble Hercules.</p>
<p>Lo, who of Fortune’s dice may trust the throw?</p>
<p>For he that follows all this world, at ease,</p>
<p>Ere he’s aware, is often laid full low.</p>
<p>Full wise is he that seeks himself to know!</p>
<p>Beware, for when Fortune shall dispose,</p>
<p>Then she waits her man to overthrow</p>
<p>By such means as he might least suppose.</p>

<p>The mighty throne, the precious treasure,</p>
<p>The glorious sceptre, and royal majesty</p>
<p>That this King possessed, Nebuchadnezzar,</p>
<p>By human tongue can scarce described be.</p>
<p>He twice took Jerusalem the city;</p>
<p>The vessels of the Temple he then bade</p>
<p>Men take to Babylon his Sovereign See,</p>
<p>Where he his glory and his pleasure had.</p>
<p>The fine male children of the blood royal</p>
<p>Of Israel he gelded them anon,</p>
<p>Making every one of them his thrall.</p>
<p>Amongst others Daniel was one,</p>
<p>Who was the wisest child of anyone;</p>
<p>For he the dreams of the king expounded,</p>
<p>While in Chaldea wise man was there none</p>
<p>Who knew what end his dreams had sounded.</p>
<p>The proud king had a statue made of gold,</p>
<p>Sixty cubits long and seven in breadth,</p>
<p>To which image both the young and old</p>
<p>Were ordered to bow down, and bow in dread,</p>
<p>Or in a fiery furnace, burning red,</p>
<p>Be burnt if they chose to disobey.</p>
<p>But Daniel would not assent, instead</p>
<p>He and his two companions went their way.</p>
<p>The king of kings, was so proud and great</p>
<p>He thought that God who sits in majesty</p>
<p>Could never strip him of his high estate.</p>
<p>Yet suddenly he fell from dignity,</p>
<p>And like a beast then he seemed to be,</p>
<p>And ate hay like an ox, and all about,</p>
<p>In the rain, with wild beasts walked he,</p>
<p>Until all God’s allotted time was out.</p>
<p>And like an eagle’s feathers was his hair;</p>
<p>His nails like a bird’s claws did appear,</p>
<p>Till God released him from his madness there,</p>
<p>Restored his wits; and then with many a tear</p>
<p>He thanked God, and lived his life in fear</p>
<p>Of acting thus amiss, of more disgrace;</p>
<p>And till the day he laid was on his bier,</p>
<p>He paid witness to God’s might and grace.</p>

<p>Now, his son, who was named Belshazzar,</p>
<p>And reigned there after his father’s day,</p>
<p>Learned nothing himself from all that matter,</p>
<p>For proud he was of heart, and loved display.</p>
<p>And an idolater he was always.</p>
<p>His high estate filled his heart with pride;</p>
<p>But Fortune cast him down, and there he lay,</p>
<p>And his kingdom others did divide.</p>
<p>A feast he made once for his lords all</p>
<p>On a day, and they were blithe and merry,</p>
<p>And then to his officers he did call:</p>
<p>‘Go, bring forth the vessels now,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘That my father in his prosperity</p>
<p>Out of the Temple in Jerusalem reft,</p>
<p>And to our gods give thanks must we</p>
<p>For the trophies our ancestors left.’</p>
<p>His wife, his lords, and his concubines</p>
<p>Drank on, while their appetites did last,</p>
<p>Out of those noble vessels, sundry wines.</p>
<p>And on a wall the king his eyes did cast,</p>
<p>And saw a hand, armless, that wrote full fast,</p>
<p>For fear of which he quaked and sighed full sore.</p>
<p>The hand that made Belshazzar all aghast</p>
<p>Wrote Mene, Tekel, Peres, and no more.</p>
<p>In all that land magician was there none</p>
<p>Who could expound what the letters meant.</p>
<p>But Daniel expounded it anon</p>
<p>Saying: ‘King, God to your father lent</p>
<p>Glory and honour, kingdom, treasure, rent;</p>
<p>And he was proud, ignoring what God bade,</p>
<p>And therefore God His punishment He sent,</p>
<p>And bereft him of the kingdom that he had.</p>
<p>He was cast out of human company;</p>
<p>With asses was all his habitation,</p>
<p>In wet and dry, he ate like any beast,</p>
<p>Till he understood, by grace and reason,</p>
<p>That the God of Heaven has domination</p>
<p>Over every kingdom and every creature.</p>
<p>And then indeed God showed him compassion,</p>
<p>And restored his kingdom and his power.</p>
<p>And you, who are his son, are proud also,</p>
<p>And know all these things, certainly,</p>
<p>And are a rebel, and to God a foe.</p>
<p>You drink now from his vessels boldly –</p>
<p>Your wife as well, and wenches, sinfully</p>
<p>Drink from the same vessels sundry wines –</p>
<p>And worship the false gods wickedly;</p>
<p>Thus punishment will fall, this is the sign.</p>
<p>The hand was sent from God, that on the wall</p>
<p>Wrote Mene, Tekel, Peres, for, trust me,</p>
<p>Your reign is done; you weigh naught at all.</p>
<p>Divided is your kingdom, and shall be</p>
<p>To Medes and Persians given,’ thus quoth he.</p>
<p>And that same night the King he was no more,</p>
<p>And Darius occupied his degree,</p>
<p>Though he thereto had neither right nor law.</p>
<p>Lordings, from this a moral you may take</p>
<p>That lordship none securely may possess.</p>
<p>For when Fortune shall a man forsake,</p>
<p>She strips him of his kingdom and success,</p>
<p>His friends as well, the greater and the less.</p>
<p>For he whose friends are friends of Fortune too,</p>
<p>Mishap will make them enemies, I guess;</p>
<p>This proverb is both widely known and true.</p>

<p>Zenobia, of Palmyra was the queen,</p>
<p>As the Persians write, in nobleness</p>
<p>So worthy, and in arms so passing keen,</p>
<p>None could match her in courageousness,</p>
<p>Nor her lineage, nor her other greatness.</p>
<p>Of the Persian royal blood descended.</p>
<p>I do not say she was the loveliest,</p>
<p>But her beauty could not be amended.</p>
<p>From her childhood, I find she fled</p>
<p>The offices of women, to nature went,</p>
<p>And many a wild hart’s blood she shed</p>
<p>With swift arrows that through them she sent;</p>
<p>She was so fleet of foot they soon were spent.</p>
<p>And when she grew older she would kill</p>
<p>Lions, leopards, bears, so all were rent,</p>
<p>And in her arms contain them there at will.</p>
<p>She dared the wild creatures’ dens to seek,</p>
<p>And ran about the mountains in the night,</p>
<p>And slept beneath a bush; and nothing meek</p>
<p>Would wrestle by main force and main might</p>
<p>With any man, however strong in fight;</p>
<p>None to withstand her arms could be found.</p>
<p>She kept her maidenhead, her honour bright,</p>
<p>Nor deigned that she by any man be bound.</p>
<p>But at last her friends all saw her married</p>
<p>To Odenathus, prince of that country,</p>
<p>Albeit that she had for so long tarried.</p>
<p>For you must understand now that he</p>
<p>Had the same inclinations as had she.</p>
<p>And yet when they were knit together,</p>
<p>They lived in joy and in felicity,</p>
<p>For each loved, and each held dear, the other.</p>
<p>Save one thing; she never would assent</p>
<p>At any time that he might with her lie</p>
<p>Except but once, for it was her intent</p>
<p>To have a child, the race to multiply.</p>
<p>And so as soon as she did espy</p>
<p>That she was not with child by the deed,</p>
<p>She suffered him once more, by and by,</p>
<p>But only once, and then no more, indeed.</p>
<p>And if she was with child at the last,</p>
<p>No longer would she let him play the game</p>
<p>Till the full forty weeks were past;</p>
<p>Then once more did she allow the same.</p>
<p>And Odenathus, be he wild or tame,</p>
<p>He got no more of her, for thus she said:</p>
<p>It was for wives mere lechery, and shame</p>
<p>If men for other reasons with them played.</p>
<p>Two sons by Odenathus thus had she,</p>
<p>Whom she raised in virtue and the law.</p>
<p>But now unto our tale again turn we:</p>
<p>I say so worshipful a creature,</p>
<p>And wise therewith, and keeping measure,</p>
<p>So zealous in the wars, and courteous too,</p>
<p>None could more labour in the wars endure,</p>
<p>Though men indeed should seek the whole world through.</p>
<p>Her richness of display cannot be told,</p>
<p>Whether in treasure or in her clothing;</p>
<p>She was all clad in jewellery and gold.</p>
<p>And she neglected naught, for her hunting,</p>
<p>Having in sundry tongues great learning,</p>
<p>When she had leisure; and she did intend</p>
<p>To study books deeply, as was her liking,</p>
<p>And learn how in true virtue life to spend.</p>
<p>And briefly of this story to relate,</p>
<p>So brave was her husband and was she,</p>
<p>That they conquered many kingdoms great</p>
<p>In the Orient, many a fair city</p>
<p>Appertaining unto the majesty</p>
<p>Of Rome, and with strong hand held them fast.</p>
<p>And never might their foes make them flee</p>
<p>While King Odenathus’ days did last.</p>
<p>As for her battles, if of them you’d read,</p>
<p>Against Shapur the King, who was her foe,</p>
<p>And others too, and all that passed indeed,</p>
<p>How she conquered, what title had, and so</p>
<p>Afterwards of her trouble and her woe,</p>
<p>How she was besieged through her mistake –</p>
<p>Then you shall to my master Petrarch go,</p>
<p>Who wrote the most of it, I’ll undertake.</p>
<p>When Odenathus died, she mightily</p>
<p>Held all his kingdoms in her own hand</p>
<p>Against her foes she fought so cruelly</p>
<p>There was no prince or king in all that land</p>
<p>That was not glad if he should understand</p>
<p>That she’d not treat him as an enemy.</p>
<p>With her they made alliance, and did stand</p>
<p>In peace with her and quiet, and let her be.</p>
<p>The Emperor, one Claudius Gothicus,</p>
<p>And before him Gallienus, the Roman,</p>
<p>Were never in their reign so courageous,</p>
<p>Nor the Armenian, nor the Egyptian,</p>
<p>Nor the Arabian, nor the Syrian,</p>
<p>To dare to take the field with her and fight</p>
<p>Lest she should slay them by her own hand,</p>
<p>Or with her army put them all to flight.</p>
<p>In royal robes her sons were wont to go,</p>
<p>Both heirs to their father’s kingdoms all,</p>
<p>Herennianus, Timolaus, so</p>
<p>Were they named, the Persians thus did them call.</p>
<p>But Fortune with her honey mixes gall:</p>
<p>This mighty queen’s power could not endure.</p>
<p>Fortune from her kingdom saw her fall,</p>
<p>Into wretchedness, through misadventure.</p>
<p>Aurelian, when that the governance</p>
<p>Of Rome fell into his hands, I say,</p>
<p>He set himself on her to wreak vengeance,</p>
<p>And with his legions he made his way</p>
<p>Towards Zenobia; and on a day</p>
<p>He made her flee, and as was his intent,</p>
<p>Took and fettered her, and her children they</p>
<p>Were taken too, and home to Rome he went.</p>
<p>Amongst the other trophies that he won,</p>
<p>Her chariot all of gold, her jewellery,</p>
<p>This great Roman, this Aurelian,</p>
<p>Brought back with him, for all the world to see.</p>
<p>The vanguard of his Triumph there walked she,</p>
<p>With golden chains about her neck hanging;</p>
<p>Crowned she was, according to degree,</p>
<p>And full of gems was charged her clothing.</p>
<p>Alas, Fortune! She that but lately was</p>
<p>The terror of high kings and emperors,</p>
<p>All the people gazed on her, alas!</p>
<p>And she that was all helmeted in the wars,</p>
<p>And by force won strong towns and towers,</p>
<p>Shall on her head now wear a veil light;</p>
<p>And she that bore a sceptre wreathed with flowers,</p>
<p>Shall bear a distaff, thus her costs requite.</p>

<p>O noble, O worthy Pedro, glory of Spain,</p>
<p>Whom Fortune held in such high majesty,</p>
<p>Of your piteous death should men complain!</p>
<p>Out of your land your brother made you flee;</p>
<p>And afterwards, through siege and subtlety</p>
<p>You were betrayed and led unto his tent.</p>
<p>Where with his own hand he slew thee,</p>
<p>Succeeding to your kingdom and your rent.</p>
<p>The silver field with eagle black therein,</p>
<p>Caught with a limed rod, stained red, indeed,</p>
<p>He brewed this wickedness and all this sin!</p>
<p>Mauny, the ‘evil nest’, he worked this deed –</p>
<p>No Oliver, to Charlemagne, who took heed</p>
<p>Of truth and honour, but from Armorica</p>
<p>A Ganelon, corrupted by his greed,</p>
<p>He brought this worthy king to disaster.</p>

<p>O worthy Peter, King of Cyprus, also,</p>
<p>Who won Alexandria by high mastery,</p>
<p>On full many a heathen you wrought woe,</p>
<p>At which your own liegemen felt great envy,</p>
<p>And for no other cause but your chivalry</p>
<p>They in your bed slew you on the morrow.</p>
<p>So does Fortune guide her wheel, you see,</p>
<p>And out of joy brings men to sorrow.</p>

<p>Of Milan great Bernarbò Visconti,</p>
<p>God of delight, and scourge of Lombardy,</p>
<p>Why should I not of your misfortune speak,</p>
<p>Since in estate you climbed so highly?</p>
<p>Your brother’s son, doubly bound to thee,</p>
<p>For he your nephew was and son-in-law,</p>
<p>Within his prison slew you in misery.</p>
<p>But of why, or how, I know no more.</p>

<p>What Ugolino of Pisa did endure</p>
<p>No tongue may tell of it for pity.</p>
<p>A little outside Pisa stands a tower,</p>
<p>In which tower imprisoned once was he,</p>
<p>And with him his little children three;</p>
<p>The eldest scarcely five years was in age.</p>
<p>Alas, Fortune! It was great cruelty</p>
<p>To lock up birds like this in such a cage!</p>
<p>Condemned he was to die in that prison,</p>
<p>For Ruggieri, Pisa’s Bishop, lies</p>
<p>Told, false charges made at his suggestion,</p>
<p>Through which the people did up-rise,</p>
<p>And cast him in prison, in such wise</p>
<p>As you have heard; and meat and drink he had</p>
<p>So little, that it might scarcely suffice,</p>
<p>And it was also poor in kind and bad.</p>
<p>And on a day it befell, in that hour</p>
<p>When that his meat was wont to be brought,</p>
<p>The gaoler shut the doors of the tower.</p>
<p>He heard it right enough, but he spoke naught,</p>
<p>And to his mind there came anon a thought,</p>
<p>That they from hunger would let him die.</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ quoth he, ‘alas that I was wrought!’</p>
<p>And at that the tear fell from his eye.</p>
<p>His young son, that was three years of age,</p>
<p>Unto him: ‘Father,’ said, ‘why do you weep?</p>
<p>When will the gaoler bring our pottage?</p>
<p>Is there a morsel of that bread you keep?</p>
<p>I am so hungry that I cannot sleep.</p>
<p>Now would God that I might sleep forever!</p>
<p>Then would no hunger through my stomach creep;</p>
<p>There is naught but bread shall aid me ever.’</p>
<p>Thus day after day the child did cry,</p>
<p>Till in his father’s lap adown he lay,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Farewell, father, I must die!’</p>
<p>Kissed his father, and died that very day.</p>
<p>And when the woeful father saw this, pray,</p>
<p>For woe he started his two arms to bite,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Alas, Fortune, and well-away!</p>
<p>False wheel, for my woe, I blame you outright.’</p>
<p>His children thought from hunger thus it was</p>
<p>That he his arms gnawed, and not from woe,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Dear father, do not so, alas,</p>
<p>But rather eat the flesh that on us grows.</p>
<p>Our flesh you gave us, take the flesh we owe,</p>
<p>And eat your fill.’ – Right thus they to him said.</p>
<p>And after that, within a day or so,</p>
<p>They lay in his lap and they were dead.</p>
<p>He himself despairs, from hunger starved.</p>
<p>Thus this mighty Earl of Pisa dies!</p>
<p>From high estate Fortune has him carved.</p>
<p>Of tragedy these words should now suffice;</p>
<p>Who desires it in a longer wise,</p>
<p>May read the great poet of Italy</p>
<p>Dante, that is, for he did it devise</p>
<p>Point by point; and every word there see.</p>
<p><span class="play-char">Nero</span></p>
<p>Although this Nero was as vicious</p>
<p>As any fiend that is beneath the ground,</p>
<p>Yet he, as so says Suetonius,</p>
<p>Had in subjection this great world, all found,</p>
<p>From East to West, South to North around.</p>
<p>With rubies, sapphires and with pearls pure white</p>
<p>Were all his clothes embroidered up and down,</p>
<p>For in gemstones he did greatly delight.</p>
<p>More delicate, more pompous in display,</p>
<p>More proud was never Emperor than he.</p>
<p>The same clothes that he had worn a day,</p>
<p>After that time he never more must see.</p>
<p>Nets of gold thread had he in great plenty,</p>
<p>To fish the Tiber when he wished to play.</p>
<p>His desires were all made law by decree,</p>
<p>For Fortune as his friend did him obey.</p>
<p>He burnt Rome for his own pleasure, ay,</p>
<p>The Senators he slew upon a day,</p>
<p>To hear how those men would weep and cry,</p>
<p>Slew his brother, and by his sister lay.</p>
<p>Of his mother made piteous display,</p>
<p>For he cut up her womb, to behold</p>
<p>Where he was conceived; oh, well-away,</p>
<p>In such disdain did he his mother hold.</p>
<p>No tears fell from his eyes at the sight</p>
<p>He only said: ‘A fair woman was she!’</p>
<p>A wonder is it how he could or might</p>
<p>Be the judge concerning her dead beauty.</p>
<p>The wine to be brought commanded he,</p>
<p>And drank anon; no other grief displayed.</p>
<p>When great power is joined to cruelty,</p>
<p>Alas, too deep in venom men must wade!</p>
<p>In youth a teacher had this Emperor,</p>
<p>To teach him literature and courtesy,</p>
<p>For of morality he was the flower</p>
<p>At that time, unless the books deceive,</p>
<p>And while this teacher had the mastery,</p>
<p>He made him so learned and so supple</p>
<p>That it was long before his tyranny</p>
<p>Or any vice did mind from heart uncouple.</p>
<p>This Seneca, of whom I now advise,</p>
<p>Because Nero held him in such dread,</p>
<p>Since for vice he would him thus chastise,</p>
<p>Privately, not by word but deed, I’ve read –</p>
<p>‘Sire,’ would he say, ‘an Emperor instead</p>
<p>Should love virtue and loath tyranny –</p>
<p>For which in a bath Seneca lay and bled</p>
<p>From both his arms, till his life did flee.</p>
<p>This Nero had acquired a habit once;</p>
<p>In youth against his master so to rise,</p>
<p>That afterward with him became a grievance;</p>
<p>Therefore he made him die in this wise.</p>
<p>But nonetheless this Seneca the wise</p>
<p>Chose in a bath to die in this manner,</p>
<p>Rather than face death in some other guise.</p>
<p>And thus did Nero slay his master dear.</p>
<p>Now it befell, that Fortune wished no longer</p>
<p>To cherish Nero in his soaring pride,</p>
<p>For, though he was strong, she was stronger.</p>
<p>She thought thus: ‘By God, how ill advised</p>
<p>To raise a man so filled with every vice</p>
<p>To high degree and Emperor him call!</p>
<p>By God, I’ll pull him down in a trice;</p>
<p>When he least expects it, then he’ll fall.’</p>
<p>The people rose upon him in the night</p>
<p>Against his wickedness, when this he spied,</p>
<p>Out of his doors anon he rushed in flight</p>
<p>Alone, and there he though he’d find allied</p>
<p>Old friends, knocked hard, but the more he sped</p>
<p>The swifter they shut the doors and all.</p>
<p>Then he knew he had himself misled,</p>
<p>And went his way; no longer dare he call.</p>
<p>The people cried and muttered up and down,</p>
<p>So that it reached his ears how they said:</p>
<p>‘Where’s the tyrant false, Nero the clown?’</p>
<p>For fear indeed he almost lost his head,</p>
<p>And to his gods piteously he prayed</p>
<p>For succour but none was there beside.</p>
<p>In dread of all, he thought that he was dead,</p>
<p>And ran into a garden him to hide.</p>
<p>And in the garden two churls on that day</p>
<p>Were sitting by a fire, great and red,</p>
<p>And these two churls he began to pray</p>
<p>To slay him, by striking off his head,</p>
<p>And guard his body, when that he was dead,</p>
<p>From mutilation, and from acts of shame.</p>
<p>Himself he slew, last remedy, instead;</p>
<p>At which Fortune laughed, as if in game.</p>

<p>There was never general to a king</p>
<p>That held more kingdoms in subjection,</p>
<p>None stronger in the field in everything</p>
<p>In his time, or higher in distinction,</p>
<p>Nor more vainglorious in his presumption</p>
<p>Than Holofernes, whom Fortune had kissed</p>
<p>So amorously, and led him up and down,</p>
<p>Till that his head was off, before he list.</p>
<p>Not only did the world hold him in awe</p>
<p>For fear of losing wealth and liberty,</p>
<p>But he made every man abjure God’s law.</p>
<p>‘Nebuchadnezzar is your god’, said he;</p>
<p>‘No other god shall there worshipped be.’</p>
<p>Against his order no man dare trespass,</p>
<p>Save in Bethulia, a powerful city,</p>
<p>Where Eliachim, the high priest was.</p>

<p>But take note of the death of Holofernes:</p>
<p>Amidst his host he lies there drunk one night,</p>
<p>In his tent, like a barn, to sleep he turns;</p>
<p>And yet, for all his pomp and all his might,</p>
<p>Judith, a woman, as he lay upright</p>
<p>Sleeping, his head smote off, and from his tent</p>
<p>Full secretly she stole, ere morning light,</p>
<p>And with his head off to her home she went.</p>

<p>What need to tell of King Antiochus,</p>
<p>Or to describe his royal majesty,</p>
<p>His high pride, his deeds so venomous?</p>
<p>There was not such another one as he.</p>
<p>Read what is said of him in Maccabee,</p>
<p>And read the proud words that he said,</p>
<p>And why he fell from high prosperity,</p>
<p>And on a hillside wretchedly lay dead.</p>
<p>Fortune had advanced him so in pride</p>
<p>That truly he thought he might attain</p>
<p>Unto the stars, upon every side,</p>
<p>And weigh in the balance every mountain,</p>
<p>And all the waves of the sea restrain.</p>
<p>And God’s people held he most in hate;</p>
<p>Them would he slay in torment and in pain,</p>
<p>Thinking that God would not his pride abate.</p>
<p>And because Nicanor and Timothy</p>
<p>Had by the Jews been conquered easily,</p>
<p>For those same Jews such hatred showed he</p>
<p>That he bade his chariot readied swiftly,</p>
<p>And swore an oath, and said wrathfully</p>
<p>That Jerusalem would dance to his tune,</p>
<p>And he’d wreak vengeance on it cruelly –</p>
<p>But of his purpose he was foiled full soon.</p>
<p>God for his threats smote him and so sore</p>
<p>With an invisible wound, incurable,</p>
<p>That in his guts it carved so, and did gnaw,</p>
<p>That his pain proved insupportable.</p>
<p>And that was a vengeance all rational,</p>
<p>For many a man’s guts he rent in pain.</p>
<p>Yet from his purpose cursed and damnable,</p>
<p>For all his hurt, could not himself restrain.</p>
<p>But gave the word to summon all his host,</p>
<p>And swiftly, ere he was of it aware,</p>
<p>God dented all his pride and all his boast;</p>
<p>For he fell sorely from his chariot there,</p>
<p>So that his limbs and skin began to tear,</p>
<p>And he might no longer walk or ride,</p>
<p>But men bore him about in a chair</p>
<p>All bruised severely, both back and side.</p>
<p>God’s vengeance smote him so cruelly</p>
<p>That through his body evil worms crept,</p>
<p>And therewithal he stank so terribly</p>
<p>That none of all his company that kept</p>
<p>By him then, whether he woke or slept,</p>
<p>Could the very stink of him endure.</p>
<p>In this troubling he wailed and wept,</p>
<p>And knew God the lord of every creature.</p>
<p>To all his host, and to himself also,</p>
<p>Full loathsome was the stink of his frame;</p>
<p>No man could bear to carry him to and fro.</p>
<p>And gripped by this stench and deadly pain</p>
<p>He starved full wretchedly, on a mountain.</p>
<p>Thus had this robber and this homicide,</p>
<p>Who made many men weep and complain,</p>
<p>The reward that is earned by excess pride.</p>

<p>Alexander’s story is so well known</p>
<p>That all who reach the age of discretion</p>
<p>Have heard some or all of his fortune.</p>
<p>This wide world, indeed, in conclusion,</p>
<p>He’d won by strength, or by his high renown,</p>
<p>Men sued for peace and to him did send.</p>
<p>The pride of man and beast he brought down,</p>
<p>Wherever he went, unto the world’s end.</p>
<p>And comparison might no man make</p>
<p>Between him and any other conqueror;</p>
<p>For all this world for dread of him did quake.</p>
<p>Of knighthood and freedom he was the flower;</p>
<p>Fortune made him heir to all her honour.</p>
<p>Save wine and women, nothing might assuage</p>
<p>His high intent on warfare and its labour,</p>
<p>So filled was he with a lion’s courage.</p>
<p>What praise were it to him then, if I told</p>
<p>Of Darius, and a hundred thousand foes,</p>
<p>Of kings, princes, dukes, and earls bold,</p>
<p>How he conquered them, and swelled their woes?</p>
<p>I say, as far as men may ride or go,</p>
<p>The world was his; what more can I advise?</p>
<p>For though I wrote and wandered, to and fro,</p>
<p>About his chivalry, it would not suffice.</p>
<p>Twelve years he reigned, as says Maccabee;</p>
<p>And Philip’s son, of Macedon, was he,</p>
<p>The first who was king in Greece’s country.</p>
<p>O worthy noble Alexander, alas,</p>
<p>That you should ever come to such a pass!</p>
<p>Poisoned were you by your folk I fear.</p>
<p>Fortune your sixes aces made, at last,</p>
<p>And yet for you she wept never a tear.</p>
<p>Who shall give me tears to complain</p>
<p>Of the death of nobility’s franchise,</p>
<p>Who counted all the world as his domain,</p>
<p>And yet considered it could not suffice,</p>
<p>So full was his mind of high enterprise?</p>
<p>Alas, who shall help me to indict</p>
<p>False Fortune, and poison to despise?</p>
<p>– Of whose blame for all this woe I write.</p>

<p>By wisdom, manliness, and great labour,</p>
<p>From humble bed to royal majesty</p>
<p>Up rose Julius the Conqueror,</p>
<p>Who won the Occident by land and sea,</p>
<p>By strength of hand, or else by treaty,</p>
<p>And unto Rome made them tributary;</p>
<p>And then of Rome the Emperor was he,</p>
<p>Till Fortune rose as his adversary.</p>
<p>O mighty Caesar, who in Thessaly</p>
<p>Fought against Pompey, your son-in-law,</p>
<p>Who of the Orient ruled the chivalry</p>
<p>As far as the dawn of day and more,</p>
<p>Through your power they their death’s day saw,</p>
<p>Save a few folk that with Pompey fled,</p>
<p>And thus of you the Orient stood in awe;</p>
<p>Thank Fortune that stood you in such stead!</p>
<p>But for a little while let me bewail</p>
<p>That Pompey, that noble governor</p>
<p>Of Rome, who in this war did fail.</p>
<p>I say, one of his men, a false traitor,</p>
<p>Smote off his head, to win great favour</p>
<p>From Julius, and him the head he brought.</p>
<p>Alas, Pompey, of the Orient conqueror,</p>
<p>That Fortune to such an end you brought!</p>
<p>To Rome again returned our Julius</p>
<p>In triumph crowned with laurel for to be.</p>
<p>But one day, Brutus and Cassius,</p>
<p>Who ever showed for his estate envy,</p>
<p>Brought to fruition their conspiracy</p>
<p>Against this Julius in subtle wise,</p>
<p>And chose the very place where die must he</p>
<p>Beneath their daggers, as I shall advise.</p>
<p>Thus Julius to the Capitol went</p>
<p>One day, where he was wont to go,</p>
<p>In the Capitol they seized him then,</p>
<p>That false Brutus and his other foes,</p>
<p>And struck him with their daggers so</p>
<p>That he had many a wound, there he did lie,</p>
<p>But groaned he at no stroke but one, I know,</p>
<p>Or else at two, unless the stories lie.</p>
<p>So manly was this Julius at heart,</p>
<p>And so in love with honest dignity,</p>
<p>That though his wounds gave him sore smart,</p>
<p>His mantle about his hips cast he,</p>
<p>That no man should steal his privacy.</p>
<p>And as he lay dying in a trance,</p>
<p>And knew that in truth dead was he,</p>
<p>Of dignity he still kept remembrance.</p>
<p>In Lucan this tale I recommend,</p>
<p>And Suetonius, Valerius also,</p>
<p>Who this story wrote from end to end,</p>
<p>How that to these great conquerors so</p>
<p>Fortune was first friend, and then their foe.</p>
<p>We may not trust in her great favour long,</p>
<p>But watch her with suspicion as we go;</p>
<p>Witness all these conquerors so strong.</p>

<p>This rich Croesus, king of Lydia,</p>
<p>Croesus whom Cyrus held in dread,</p>
<p>Was captured still, midst of all his pride there,</p>
<p>And to be burnt men to the fire him led;</p>
<p>But such a rain down from the heavens shed</p>
<p>The fire was doused, and he made his escape.</p>
<p>But to beware it no thought had he had,</p>
<p>Till Fortune on the gallows made him gape.</p>
<p>When he escaped, he was still intent</p>
<p>On starting on another war again.</p>
<p>He believed that fortune had it sent,</p>
<p>The manner in which he escaped by rain,</p>
<p>And that by his foes he might not be slain;</p>
<p>And then with a dream one night he met,</p>
<p>Of which he was so proud and so vain</p>
<p>That on vengeance all his heart he set.</p>
<p>Upon a tree he perched, or so he thought,</p>
<p>Where Jupiter bathed him, back and side,</p>
<p>While Phoebus a fair towel then him brought</p>
<p>To dry him with, and so increased his pride.</p>
<p>And so his daughter, who stood beside,</p>
<p>Whom he knew with wisdom did abound,</p>
<p>He bade her tell him what it signified,</p>
<p>And she his dream began thus to expound:</p>
<p>‘The tree,’ she said the gallows-tree does mean,</p>
<p>And Jupiter betokens snow and rain,</p>
<p>And Phoebus, with his towel so clean,</p>
<p>There as the sun beams, that is plain.</p>
<p>You shall be hanged father: I say again</p>
<p>Rain shall wash you, and the sun shall dry.’</p>
<p>Thus she warned him fully, but in vain:</p>
<p>His daughter, she was Phanya, say I.</p>
<p>Hanged was Croesus then, the proud king;</p>
<p>His royal sceptre was of no avail.</p>
<p>Tragedy no other manner of thing</p>
<p>Can in its singing cry for or bewail</p>
<p>Than how Fortune always shall assail</p>
<p>With sudden stroke the kingdom of the proud;</p>
<p>For when men trust in her then she shall fail,</p>
<p>And cover her bright features with a cloud……..</p>

<p>‘Ho!’ quoth the Knight, ‘good sire, no more of this!</p>
<p>What you said is right enough, true it is</p>
<p>And more, since a little grief and sadness</p>
<p>Is due most folk, that’s right enough I guess.</p>
<p>As for myself, it’s great distress to me</p>
<p>When men have been in great wealth and ease,</p>
<p>To hear then of their sudden fall, alas!</p>
<p>And the contrary is joy and great solace,</p>
<p>When a man that has been of poor estate,</p>
<p>Climbs up above and proves so fortunate</p>
<p>That he abides there in prosperity.</p>
<p>Such a thing is cheerful, it seems to me,</p>
<p>And of such things it is good news to tell.’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ quoth our Host, ‘by Saint Paul’s bell,</p>
<p>You speak the truth! This Monk, he cries aloud</p>
<p>Of how Dame Fortune covered with a cloud</p>
<p>I know not what, and speaks of tragedy –</p>
<p>As you have heard; yet, faith, no remedy</p>
<p>Is it to bewail these things or complain</p>
<p>When they are done, and also it brings pain,</p>
<p>As you have said, to hear of heaviness.</p>
<p>Sir Monk, no more of it, may God you bless!</p>
<p>You tale annoys all this good company.</p>
<p>That sort of talk is scarcely worth a flea,</p>
<p>There’s no amusement in it, and no game.</p>
<p>Wherefore, Sir Monk, Sir Piers by your name,</p>
<p>I pray you heartily, tell of something else;</p>
<p>Were it not for the clinking of the bells,</p>
<p>That from your bridle hang on every side,</p>
<p>By Heaven’s King, that for us all died,</p>
<p>I should ere this have tumbled down in sleep,</p>
<p>Though the slough below were ever so deep.</p>
<p>Then would your tale have been told in vain!</p>
<p>For certainly, as the clerks make plain,</p>
<p>Whenever a man lacks an audience,</p>
<p>No use his uttering a single sentence.</p>
<p>And well I know, the capacity is in me,</p>
<p>As to whether anything well told shall be.</p>
<p>Sire, say something of hunting, I you pray.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the Monk, ‘I have no wish to play.</p>
<p>Now, let another speak, my tale is told.’</p>
<p>Then spoke our Host with rude speech and bold,</p>
<p>And said unto the Nun’s Priest anon:</p>
<p>‘Come near, good priest; come hither, now Sir John!</p>
<p>Tell us such things as make the heart glad.</p>
<p>Be blithe now, though you ride upon a nag!</p>
<p>What though your horse be miserable and lean?</p>
<p>If he will serve, why should you care a bean!</p>
<p>See that your heart is ever merry, though.’</p>
<p>‘Yea, sire,’ quoth he,’ yea, Host, and I will so,</p>
<p>Not to be merry now would bring me blame.’</p>
<p>And right anon now he took up the game.</p>
<p>And thus he spoke unto us everyone,</p>
<p>This sweet Priest, this goodly man, Sir John.</p>

<p>A poor widow, somewhat bent with age,</p>
<p>Lived, long ago, in a little cottage,</p>
<p>Beside a grove, standing in a dale.</p>
<p>The widow of whom I tell this tale,</p>
<p>Since the day when she was last a wife,</p>
<p>Led, patiently, a very simple life,</p>
<p>For little was her property or rent.</p>
<p>By husbandry, such as God her sent,</p>
<p>She kept herself, and two daughters poor.</p>
<p>Three large sows had she, of swine no more,</p>
<p>Three cows, and a sheep, as well, called Molly.</p>
<p>Full sooty was her bower, all melancholy,</p>
<p>In which she ate full many a scanty meal.</p>
<p>No pungent sauce was needed for her veal;</p>
<p>No dainty morsel ever passed her throat.</p>
<p>Her diet, her cottage struck a single note.</p>
<p>Repletion thus had never made her sick;</p>
<p>And a moderate diet was all her physic,</p>
<p>And exercise, and the heart’s abundance.</p>
<p>The gout no reason gave her not to dance,</p>
<p>No apoplexy smote her in the head.</p>
<p>No wine drank she, neither white nor red.</p>
<p>Her board was mostly of the white and black –</p>
<p>Milk and brown bread, of which she had no lack,</p>
<p>Grilled bacon, and an egg or two, I say,</p>
<p>For she was, as it were, a dairy maid.</p>
<p>A yard she had, enclosed all about</p>
<p>With palings, and a dry ditch without,</p>
<p>In which there roamed a cock called Chanticleer.</p>
<p>In all the land, at crowing he’d no peer;</p>
<p>His voice was merrier than the merry organ</p>
<p>On Mass days in the chapel there, piping on.</p>
<p>Truer was his crowing in the lodge</p>
<p>Than is a clock or abbey horologe.</p>
<p>By nature he knew the right ascension</p>
<p>Of the celestial equator, I’ll mention:</p>
<p>For each fifteen degrees of its ascending,</p>
<p>He would crow, as needed no amending.</p>
<p>His comb redder than the finest coral,</p>
<p>Was crenellated like the castle wall.</p>
<p>His bill was black, and as the jet it shone;</p>
<p>Like azure were his legs and toes, as one;</p>
<p>His claws were whiter than the lily flower,</p>
<p>And like the burnished gold all his colour.</p>
<p>This noble cock had in his governance</p>
<p>Seven hens, his pleasure to advance,</p>
<p>Who were his sisters and his paramours,</p>
<p>And wonderfully like him, as to colours;</p>
<p>Of which the fairest, tinted round her throat,</p>
<p>Was called the lovely lady Pertelote.</p>
<p>Courteous she was, discreet and debonair,</p>
<p>Companionable, and bore herself so fair</p>
<p>From the day that she was seven nights old,</p>
<p>That truly the heart she held in her hold</p>
<p>Of Chanticleer, locked in her every limb.</p>
<p>He loved her so that all was well with him.</p>
<p>And such a joy was it to hear them sing</p>
<p>When that the bright sun began to spring,</p>
<p>In sweet accord, ‘My love’s in foreign land’.</p>
<p>– For at that time, I’m given to understand,</p>
<p>Beasts and birds as well could speak and sing.</p>
<p>And it so befell, that in the early dawning,</p>
<p>As Chanticleer among his wives all</p>
<p>Sat on his perch, lodged within the hall,</p>
<p>And next to him sat the fair Pertelote,</p>
<p>Chanticleer began moaning in his throat,</p>
<p>Like a man who in a dream is troubled sore.</p>
<p>And when Pertelote thus heard him roar,</p>
<p>She was aghast, and said, ‘My heart, dear,</p>
<p>What ails you, to moan as you do here?</p>
<p>Fie, what a sleeper! What a noise, for shame!’</p>
<p>And he answered her, saying thus: ‘Dear dame,</p>
<p>I pray you not to take my noise amiss.</p>
<p>By God, I thought I was in such mischief</p>
<p>Just now, my heart is pounding yet with fright!</p>
<p>Now God’, quoth he, ‘read my dream aright,</p>
<p>And keep my body from foul prison now!</p>
<p>I dreamed that I wandered up and down</p>
<p>Within our yard, and saw a kind of beast</p>
<p>Shaped like a hound, that would have seized</p>
<p>My body, and I seemed as good as dead.</p>
<p>His colour was betwixt yellow and red,</p>
<p>And tipped was his tail, and both his ears,</p>
<p>With black, unlike the rest of all his hairs.</p>
<p>His snout was small, and he was fiery eyed.</p>
<p>– Of his mere looks alone I almost died!</p>
<p>And this caused all my moaning, doubtless.’</p>
<p>‘For shame!’ quoth she, ‘fie on timorousness!</p>
<p>Alas!’ quoth she, ‘for, by the Lord above,</p>
<p>Now have you lost my heart and all my love!</p>
<p>I cannot love a coward, by my faith!</p>
<p>For certainly, whatever women say,</p>
<p>They all desire, if it might truly be,</p>
<p>A husband who is brave, and wise and free,</p>
<p>Discreet as well, no miser, and no fool,</p>
<p>Nor one aghast at every warlike tool,</p>
<p>Nor yet a boaster, by our Lord above!</p>
<p>How dare you say for shame, to your love,</p>
<p>That anything at all makes you a-feared?</p>
<p>Where is your man’s heart to match your beard?</p>
<p>Alas, and are you aghast at dreaming?</p>
<p>God knows, dreams are vanity or nothing.</p>
<p>Dreams are engendered by indigestion,</p>
<p>And bodily exhalations and their action,</p>
<p>And excessive humours dreams excite.</p>
<p>For sure, this dream that you met with tonight</p>
<p>Comes from the greater superfluity</p>
<p>Of your red choler, as it seems to me,</p>
<p>Which causes folks to be in dread, in dreams.</p>
<p>Of arrows, and the fire’s reddening gleams,</p>
<p>Of red beasts also, lest they seek to bite,</p>
<p>Of warfare, and whelps both fierce and slight</p>
<p>– Just as the humour of melancholy</p>
<p>Causes full many a man to cry in sleep</p>
<p>For fear of black bears, or bulls black,</p>
<p>Or else black devils clinging to his back.</p>
<p>Of other humours I could tell also,</p>
<p>That work a man in sleep many a woe,</p>
<p>But I’ll pass on as lightly as I can.</p>
<p>Lo, Cato was ever so wise a man,</p>
<p>Did he not say: “Take no account of dreams”?</p>
<p>Now sire,’ quoth she, ‘when we flee our beam,</p>
<p>For God’s love, go take a laxative!</p>
<p>On peril of my soul, long days to live,</p>
<p>That’s the best counsel, and no deceit,</p>
<p>To purge both choler and melancholy;</p>
<p>And lest you find an excuse to tarry,</p>
<p>Because the town has no apothecary,</p>
<p>I myself the right herbs will show you</p>
<p>That bring both health to us and profit too.</p>
<p>And in our own yard these herbs I’ll find,</p>
<p>Which in their properties are of the kind</p>
<p>To purge below, and do the same above.</p>
<p>Don’t neglect them now, for God’s own love!</p>
<p>You are quite choleric in complexion;</p>
<p>Beware lest the sun in his ascension</p>
<p>Find you all replete with humours hot!</p>
<p>And if he does, I’ll bet a groat it’s not</p>
<p>Long before you’ve a fever, a tertian,</p>
<p>Or an ague that may prove your bane.</p>
<p>A day or two you’ll need digestives</p>
<p>Of worms, before you take your laxatives,</p>
<p>Of laurel, centaury, and fumitory,</p>
<p>Or else hellebore that grows so freely,</p>
<p>Of caper-spurge or the blackthorn berry,</p>
<p>Or plantain, growing in our yard, so merry.</p>
<p>Peck them as they grow, and take them in!</p>
<p>Be merry, husband, by your father’s kin!</p>
<p>Fear you no dream – What I can say more?’</p>
<p>‘Madame’ quoth he, ‘graunt merci for your lore!</p>
<p>But nonetheless, regarding Cato now,</p>
<p>Who for his wisdom won such great renown,</p>
<p>Though he bade us hold no dream in dread,</p>
<p>By God! Men have in old books often read</p>
<p>In many a text of more authority</p>
<p>Than ever Cato’s had, God prosper me,</p>
<p>The very reverse of all Cato’s sense</p>
<p>And have found in their experience</p>
<p>That dreams to us are significations</p>
<p>Both of the joys and the tribulations</p>
<p>That folk suffer in this life at present.</p>
<p>There is no need for any argument;</p>
<p>The proof itself is shown by the deed.</p>
<p>One of the greatest authors that men read,</p>
<p>Cicero, says thus: two friends once went</p>
<p>On pilgrimage, with serious intent;</p>
<p>And it so chanced, they came to a town</p>
<p>Where they such a congregation found</p>
<p>Of people, and so many folk in passage,</p>
<p>That there was not so much as a cottage</p>
<p>In which they might both lodge for a fee. </p>
<p>So that they had, out of necessity</p>
<p>For that one night, to part company;</p>
<p>And each of them went to a hostelry,</p>
<p>And found a lodging as it might befall,</p>
<p>So one of them was lodged in a stall,</p>
<p>Far off, in a yard, with oxen used to plough;</p>
<p>The other man was lodged well, I vow,</p>
<p>As chance favoured him, or else Fortune,</p>
<p>She that governs all of us in common.</p>
<p>And it befell that, long ere it was day,</p>
<p>The latter dreamed, in bed there as he lay,</p>
<p>That his friend began for him to call,</p>
<p>Crying: “Alas! Here in an ox’s stall,</p>
<p>This night, I shall be murdered where I lie!</p>
<p>Now help me, dearest brother, or I die!</p>
<p>Come to me, and in all haste,” he cried.</p>
<p>The man from his sleep in fear did rise;</p>
<p>But once he’d woken, and banished sleep,</p>
<p>He took a turn, and thought the thing would keep,</p>
<p>And that his dream was merely fantasy.</p>
<p>So twice in his sleep thus dreamed he,</p>
<p>And yet a third time came his friend again</p>
<p>As he thought, and said, “Now I am slain.</p>
<p>Behold my blood-stained wounds deep and wide!</p>
<p>Rise early and in the morning-tide</p>
<p>At the west gate of the town”, quoth he,</p>
<p>“A cart full of dung there you shall see,</p>
<p>In which my corpse was hidden secretly.</p>
<p>Have the carter then arrested boldly.</p>
<p>My gold caused my murder: truth I say.”</p>
<p>– And every detail of his death he gave,</p>
<p>With a full piteous face, pale of hue.</p>
<p>And trust me, next day the dream proved true;</p>
<p>For on the morrow, soon as it was day,</p>
<p>The man to his friend’s inn made his way.</p>
<p>And when he came to the ox’s stall,</p>
<p>For his friend he began to call.</p>
<p>The innkeeper answered him anon,</p>
<p>Saying: “Sire, your friend is long gone.</p>
<p>As soon as daylight came, he went from town.”</p>
<p>This the man’s suspicion did arouse,</p>
<p>Remembering the dreams he encountered;</p>
<p>And forth he went – he would wait no longer –</p>
<p>To the west gate of the town, where he found</p>
<p>A dung cart, off to fertilise the ground,</p>
<p>That was in all particulars that arise</p>
<p>The same he heard the murdered man advise.</p>
<p>And he began to cry, courageously,</p>
<p>On vengeance, justice for the felony:</p>
<p>“My friend indeed was murdered this same night,</p>
<p>And in this cart he lies gaping upright!</p>
<p>I call upon the officers”, quoth he,</p>
<p>“Charged to protect and keep this city!</p>
<p>Murder! Alas, here lies my friend, I’ll state!”</p>
<p>What more of this tale should I relate?</p>
<p>Folk ran to tip the load out on the ground,</p>
<p>And in the middle of the dung they found</p>
<p>The dead man, his murder shown anew.</p>
<p>O blissful God, who are so just and true,</p>
<p>Lo, how always murder you betray!</p>
<p>Murder will out, we say day after day.</p>
<p>Murder is so foul and abominable</p>
<p>To God, who is so just and reasonable,</p>
<p>That he will not allow it long concealed,</p>
<p>Though hidden for a year, or two, or three.</p>
<p>Murder will out: that is my conclusion.</p>
<p>And right anon, the officers of that town</p>
<p>Seized the carter, and they racked him so,</p>
<p>And then the innkeeper they racked also,</p>
<p>That they confessed their wickedness anon,</p>
<p>And were hanged high by the neck bone.</p>
<p>Thus dreams may prove serious indeed.</p>
<p>And certainly in the same book I read,</p>
<p>Right in the next chapter after this</p>
<p>– I tell no lie, and so may I find bliss –</p>
<p>Of two men who wished to pass the sea,</p>
<p>For certain reasons, into a far country,</p>
<p>If the wind had not proved contrary,</p>
<p>And made them tarry there in the city,</p>
<p>That stood full merry on the haven side.</p>
<p>But at last, towards the evening-tide,</p>
<p>The wind began to blow from the west.</p>
<p>Jolly and glad they went to their rest,</p>
<p>And vowed that in the dawn they’d set sail.</p>
<p>But hearken to my marvellous tale.</p>
<p>One of them, as deep in sleep he lay,</p>
<p>Had a wondrous dream, towards day</p>
<p>He thought a man stood by his bed-side,</p>
<p>And commanded that he should abide,</p>
<p>Saying; “If you should sail, as you intend,</p>
<p>You will be drowned; my tale is at an end.”</p>
<p>He woke, and told his friend straight away,</p>
<p>And begged him the voyage to delay;</p>
<p>And for that day, he begged him to abide.</p>
<p>His friend, indeed, who lay by his bed-side,</p>
<p>Began to laugh, and jeer at him full fast.</p>
<p>“No dream,” quoth he, “may make my heart aghast.</p>
<p>I’ll not delay my plans for anything!</p>
<p>I give never a straw for all your dreaming,</p>
<p>For dreams are but vain things, and mere japes.</p>
<p>Men dream every day of owls or apes</p>
<p>And of many a fantasy withal.</p>
<p>Men dream of things that never are at all.</p>
<p>But since I see you’re settled to abide,</p>
<p>And thus wilfully forsake the tide,</p>
<p>God knows, I’m sorry; yet, enjoy your day!”</p>
<p>– And thus he took his leave, and went his way.</p>
<p>But ere that he had half the voyage sailed,</p>
<p>I know not why, or what mischance assailed,</p>
<p>By some chance the ship’s planks were rent,</p>
<p>And ship and man beneath the water went,</p>
<p>In sight of other ships close alongside,</p>
<p>That had sailed with them on that same tide.</p>
<p>And therefore, fair Pertelote, my dear,</p>
<p>From these old examples, it does appear</p>
<p>That no man should show himself careless</p>
<p>Regarding dreams, for I say, doubtless,</p>
<p>Many a dream proves serious indeed.</p>
<p>Lo, in the life of Saint Kenelm I read,</p>
<p>Son of Kenulphus, once the noble king</p>
<p>Of Mercia, how Kenelm dreamed a thing,</p>
<p>Shortly ere he was murdered, on a day,</p>
<p>His murder in a vision saw, I say.</p>
<p>His nurse, she expounded, so they tell,</p>
<p>His dream, and bade him guard him well</p>
<p>From treason; yet he, but seven years old,</p>
<p>Took little notice of the dream he told,</p>
<p>So innocent and holy was his heart.</p>
<p>By God, I’d give my shirt, for a start,</p>
<p>If you’d read of his legend, like to me!</p>
<p>Dame Pertelote, I tell you truly,</p>
<p>Macrobius, who writes of a vision</p>
<p>Of Scipio’s in Africa, his opinion,</p>
<p>As he affirms, is that dreams may be</p>
<p>Warnings of things that later men may see.</p>
<p>And furthermore, I pray you, look you well</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, at Daniel,</p>
<p>And whether he thought dreams mere fantasy.</p>
<p>Read of Joseph too, and there you shall see</p>
<p>That dreams are sometimes – though not all –</p>
<p>Warnings of things that later do befall.</p>
<p>Look, too, at Egypt’s King, at Pharaoh,</p>
<p>At his baker and his butler also,</p>
<p>As to the consequences of their dreams!</p>
<p>Whoever meditates on ancient themes</p>
<p>May find of dreams many a wondrous thing.</p>
<p>Lo, Croesus, who was of Lydia king,</p>
<p>Did he not dream he sat upon a tree,</p>
<p>Which signified that hanged he should be?</p>
<p>Lo, there is Andromache, Hector’s wife,</p>
<p>The day that Hector would lose his life,</p>
<p>She dreamed the very same night before</p>
<p>How Hector should die and be no more</p>
<p>If he went that day into the battle.</p>
<p>She warned him, but it was of no avail;</p>
<p>He went off to fight nevertheless,</p>
<p>And was slain by Achilles, no less.</p>
<p>But the tale is all too long to tell,</p>
<p>And now it is nigh day; I may not dwell</p>
<p>On all of this, so say in conclusion,</p>
<p>That I shall have from this prevision</p>
<p>Adversity; and I say furthermore</p>
<p>By your laxatives I set no store,</p>
<p>For they are poison, I know full well.</p>
<p>I defy them; I love not their spell!</p>
<p>Now let us speak of mirth, forget all this.</p>
<p>Madame Pertelote, thus have I bliss,</p>
<p>In one thing God has sent me large grace,</p>
<p>For when I see the beauty of your face,</p>
<p>You are so scarlet-red about your eye,</p>
<p>It quenches my fears and makes them die.</p>
<p>For certain it is: In principio,</p>
<p>Mulier est hominis confusio.</p>
<p>– Madame, the meaning of the Latin is:</p>
<p>“Woman is man’s joy and all his bliss.” –</p>
<p>For when I feel a-nights your soft side,</p>
<p>– Even though I may not take a ride,</p>
<p>Because our perch so narrow is, alas! –</p>
<p>I am so full of joy and of solace,</p>
<p>That I defy both vision now and dream.’</p>
<p>And with that word, he flew down from the beam,</p>
<p>Since it was day, and also his hens all,</p>
<p>And with a ‘chuck’ began his hens to call,</p>
<p>For he had found seed lying in the yard.</p>
<p>Regal he was, no longer filled with dread;</p>
<p>He covered Pertelote some twenty times,</p>
<p>Trod her as often, ere that it was prime.</p>
<p>Like a grim lion he gazes all around,</p>
<p>And on his toes he saunters up and down;</p>
<p>He deigns not to set foot upon the ground.</p>
<p>He ‘chucks’ again each time a seed is found,</p>
<p>And to him then run his dear wives all.</p>
<p>Thus regal, as a prince is in his hall,</p>
<p>I’ll leave this Chanticleer in his pasture,</p>
<p>And next will I tell of his adventure.</p>
<p>When the month with which the world began,</p>
<p>Namely March, in which God first made man,</p>
<p>Was complete, and past again also</p>
<p>When March was done, thirty days and two,</p>
<p>Befell it, Chanticleer in all his pride,</p>
<p>His seven wives walking by his side,</p>
<p>Cast up his eyes towards the bright sun,</p>
<p>That into the sign of Taurus now had run</p>
<p>Twenty degrees and one, and somewhat more,</p>
<p>And knew by nature, and no other lore,</p>
<p>That it was prime, and crowed with blissful voice.</p>
<p>‘The sun,’ he said, ‘is climbed in heavenly course,</p>
<p>Forty degrees and one, and more, it is.</p>
<p>Madame Pertelote, my world’s bliss,</p>
<p>Hearken, these blissful brides, how they sing,</p>
<p>And see the fresh flowers how they spring!</p>
<p>Full is my heart with revel and with solace!’</p>
<p>But suddenly he fell in sorrowful case;</p>
<p>For ever the latter end of joy is woe.</p>
<p>God knows that worldly joy is swift to go;</p>
<p>And any rhetorician who fair can write</p>
<p>He in a chronicle can safely that indite,</p>
<p>As a sovereign thing to note, indeed.</p>
<p>Now ever wise man, let him list to me;</p>
<p>This story is as true, I’ll undertake,</p>
<p>As the book of Launcelot of the Lake,</p>
<p>That women hold in such great reverence.</p>
<p>Now will I turn again to my utterance.</p>
<p>A black-tipped fox of sly iniquity,</p>
<p>Who in the grove had lived years three,</p>
<p>With premeditated scheming, at a stroke,</p>
<p>That same night through hedge and fences broke,</p>
<p>Into the yard, where Chanticleer the fair</p>
<p>Was wont and his wives too, to repair;</p>
<p>And in a bed of green-stuff still he lay</p>
<p>Till it was near the middle of the day,</p>
<p>Waiting the time for Chanticleer to fall,</p>
<p>As are wont to do these homicides all</p>
<p>That lie in wait to slay innocent men.</p>
<p>O false murderer, lurking in your den!</p>
<p>O new Escariot, new Ganelon!</p>
<p>False dissimulator, O Greek Sinon,</p>
<p>Who brought Troy all utterly to sorrow!</p>
<p>O Chanticleer, accursed be the morrow</p>
<p>When you flew to the yard from the beam!</p>
<p>You were warned indeed by your dream</p>
<p>That this day would be perilous to thee.</p>
<p>– But what God foreknows must surely be,</p>
<p>In the opinion of certain clerics.</p>
<p>Ask witness of one who a true cleric is,</p>
<p>That in the schools has been great altercation</p>
<p>About this matter, and great disputation,</p>
<p>Wrought by a hundred thousand, every man.</p>
<p>But I cannot sift the flour from the bran,</p>
<p>As can the holy doctor Saint Augustine,</p>
<p>Boethius, or Bishop Bradwardine,</p>
<p>As to whether God’s noble foreknowing</p>
<p>Means that I must then do a certain thing</p>
<p>– By ‘must’ I denote simple necessity –</p>
<p>Or whether free choice may be granted me</p>
<p>To do that same thing, or to do it not,</p>
<p>Though God foreknew it ere that I was wrought,</p>
<p>Or if his knowing constrains me not at all,</p>
<p>Except by necessity conditional.</p>
<p>Well, I’ll have naught to do with the matter;</p>
<p>My tale’s of a cockerel, as you may hear,</p>
<p>Who took his wife’s counsel, but in sorrow,</p>
<p>To walk in the yard upon the morrow</p>
<p>After he’d had the dream of which I told.</p>
<p>Woman’s counsel oft leaves us dead and cold;</p>
<p>Woman’s counsel brought us first to woe,</p>
<p>And made Adam out of Paradise to go,</p>
<p>Where he had been merry and full of ease.</p>
<p>But as I know not whom it might displease</p>
<p>If I the counsel of women dare to blame,</p>
<p>Let us pass on, I speak as if in game.</p>
<p>Read the authors, treating of such matter,</p>
<p>And of women you may hear their chatter.</p>
<p>These are the cockerel’s words and not mine;</p>
<p>I wish no harm to any woman divine.</p>
<p>Fair in the dust, to bathe her doth lie,</p>
<p>Pertelote, with all her sisters by,</p>
<p>Out in the sun, and Chanticleer so free</p>
<p>Sings merrier than a mermaid in the sea</p>
<p>(For Physiologus says for a certainty</p>
<p>That they sing right well and merrily).</p>
<p>And it so befell, that as he cast his eye,</p>
<p>Among the green-stuff, at a butterfly,</p>
<p>He suddenly saw the fox lying low,</p>
<p>No longer had a reason then to crow,</p>
<p>But he cried anon, ‘Cock, cock!’ and up did start,</p>
<p>As a man does who is a-feared at heart;</p>
<p>For by nature a beast desires to flee</p>
<p>From its enemy, if one it chance to see,</p>
<p>Though it has never seen such with its eye.</p>
<p>Now Chanticleer, when he chanced to spy</p>
<p>The fox, he would have fled, but fox anon</p>
<p>Said: ‘Noble sir, alas, will you be gone?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of me who am your friend?</p>
<p>Now, surely, I’d be worse than any fiend</p>
<p>If I should do you harm or villainy!</p>
<p>I have not come to steal your privacy;</p>
<p>But truly, the reason for my coming</p>
<p>Is only to hear how well you sing.</p>
<p>For truly, you have as merry a voice,</p>
<p>As the angels who in Heaven do rejoice.</p>
<p>And then you have in music more feeling</p>
<p>Than Boethius, or any who can sing.</p>
<p>My lord your father – God his soul now bless! –</p>
<p>And also your mother, of her great kindness,</p>
<p>Once visited my house, to my great ease.</p>
<p>And you sir, certainly, I seek to please.</p>
<p>For if men speak of singing, I must say</p>
<p>– As own the use of my two eyes I may –</p>
<p>Save for you, I never heard man sing</p>
<p>As your father did of a sweet morning.</p>
<p>Sure it was heart-felt, everything he sang!</p>
<p>And to be sure his voice full loudly rang,</p>
<p>He would take great pains that both his eyes</p>
<p>Were tight shut, so louder were his cries,</p>
<p>While standing on tiptoes therewithal,</p>
<p>And stretching out his neck long and small;</p>
<p>And also he was of such discretion</p>
<p>That there was no one in any region</p>
<p>Who in song or wisdom might him surpass.</p>
<p>I have read, in Burnellus the Ass,</p>
<p>Among its verses, how there was a cock,</p>
<p>Who, when a priest’s son gave him a knock</p>
<p>On his leg when young, served him amiss,</p>
<p>And made him lose his sovereign benefice.</p>
<p>But certainly, there’s no comparison</p>
<p>Between the wisdom and discretion</p>
<p>Of your good father, and such subtlety!</p>
<p>Now sing on, sire, for holy charity;</p>
<p>Let’s hear: can you your father emulate?’</p>
<p>Then Chanticleer his wings began to beat,</p>
<p>As one who could not foul treason see,</p>
<p>He was ravished so by such flattery.</p>
<p>Alas, you lords, many a false flatterer</p>
<p>Lives at your court, and many a cozener,</p>
<p>Who pleases you better, by my faith,</p>
<p>Than he who truthfulness does display!</p>
<p>Read Ecclesiastes on flattery;</p>
<p>Beware, you lords, of all their treachery.</p>
<p>Chanticleer stood up high on his toes,</p>
<p>Stretched out his neck, and kept his eyes closed,</p>
<p>And began to crow out loud for nones.</p>
<p>Sir Russell the fox started up at once,</p>
<p>And by the throat seized Chanticleer,</p>
<p>And on his back toward the wood, I fear,</p>
<p>Carried him off, and nobody pursued.</p>
<p>O Destiny that may not be eschewed!</p>
<p>Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beam!</p>
<p>Alas, that his wife ignored his dream!</p>
<p>– And on a Friday fell all this mischance.</p>
<p>O Venus, sweet goddess of love’s chance,</p>
<p>Since it was your servant, Chanticleer,</p>
<p>And in your service he spent his life dear,</p>
<p>More for delight than race to multiply,</p>
<p>Why suffer him on your own day to die?</p>
<p>O Geoffrey of Vinsauf, my master sovereign,</p>
<p>Who, when your great King Richard was slain</p>
<p>By a bolt, lamented his death so sore,</p>
<p>Why have I not your wisdom and your lore,</p>
<p>To chide the day, a Friday, as did you?</p>
<p>– For he was slain upon a Friday too.</p>
<p>Then my lament I would show you plain,</p>
<p>For Chanticleer’s fear, and for his pain.</p>
<p>For sure, such cries and such lamentation</p>
<p>Were never made by ladies when Ilium</p>
<p>Was won, and Pyrrhus with his drawn sword,</p>
<p>Having grasped King Priam by the beard,</p>
<p>Slew him, as Virgil’s Aeneid tells us,</p>
<p>As all those hens made in the close</p>
<p>When of Chanticleer they caught sight.</p>
<p>But above all Dame Pertelote outright</p>
<p>Cried louder than did Hasdrubal’s wife,</p>
<p>When her dear husband lost his life,</p>
<p>And the Romans set fire to Carthage;</p>
<p>She was so filled with torment and rage</p>
<p>That willingly into the flames she leapt,</p>
<p>Steadfast of heart, her tryst with death she kept.</p>
<p>O woeful hens, you cried as loudly</p>
<p>As, when Nero set fire to the city</p>
<p>Of Rome, cried all the senator’s wives,</p>
<p>Because their husbands had lost their lives;</p>
<p>In their innocence Nero had them slain.</p>
<p>Now will I turn to my tale again.</p>
<p>The poor widow, her daughters also,</p>
<p>Heard the hens cry and all their woe,</p>
<p>And out of the house they ran anon,</p>
<p>And saw the fox towards the grove had gone,</p>
<p>And on his back carried the cock away,</p>
<p>And shouted out: ‘Thief!’ and ‘Well-away!</p>
<p>It is the fox!’ – And after him they ran,</p>
<p>And with staves many another man.</p>
<p>Ran Coll our dog, and Talbot and Gerland,</p>
<p>And Malkin with a distaff in her hand;</p>
<p>Ran cow and calf, and the very hogs,</p>
<p>Frightened by the barking of the dogs,</p>
<p>And the shouting of men and women, worst,</p>
<p>They ran so I thought their hearts would burst.</p>
<p>They yelled as the fiends do down in Hell;</p>
<p>The ducks quacked as though death loomed as well;</p>
<p>The geese for fear flew high above the trees;</p>
<p>Out of the hive came a swarm of bees.</p>
<p>So hideous was the noise – ah, benedictitee! –</p>
<p>I’m sure Jack Straw and all his company</p>
<p>Never uttered shouts one half so shrill,</p>
<p>When they wished the Flemings all to kill,</p>
<p>As this day rose up behind the fox.</p>
<p>Trumpets of brass they brought, flutes of box,</p>
<p>Of horn, of bone, to blow out loud and hoot,</p>
<p>And therewithal they shrieked and whooped;</p>
<p>It seemed as if the heavens themselves would fall!</p>
<p>Now, good men, I pray you, hearken all:</p>
<p>Lo, how Fortune alters suddenly</p>
<p>The hope and pride of their enemy!</p>
<p>The cock that lay upon the fox’s back,</p>
<p>Despite his fear, spoke to the fox: ‘Alack,</p>
<p>Sire, if I were you, as it seems to me,</p>
<p>I’d turn my head, and shout, God help me,</p>
<p>“Turn back again, you proud peasants all!</p>
<p>And a foul pestilence upon you fall!</p>
<p>Now I have reached the woodland-side,</p>
<p>Despite your chase, the cock shall here abide.</p>
<p>I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!”’</p>
<p>The fox said, ‘By my faith, it shall be done!’</p>
<p>– And as he spoke the words, all suddenly,</p>
<p>The cock broke from his mouth full swiftly,</p>
<p>And high into a tree he flew anon.</p>
<p>And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ quoth he, ‘O Chanticleer, alas!</p>
<p>I have done you,’ quoth he, ‘a foul trespass,</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I rendered you a-feared,</p>
<p>When I seized you and then brought you here.</p>
<p>But sire, I did it with no harsh intent;</p>
<p>Come down, and I’ll explain what I meant.</p>
<p>God help me, I’ll tell you all the truth!’</p>
<p>‘Nay, then’ quoth he, ‘and curses on us two!</p>
<p>And first I’ll curse myself, both blood and bones,</p>
<p>If you deceive me oftener than once!</p>
<p>You shall no more, with your foul flattery,</p>
<p>Make me sing, close my eyes so foolishly;</p>
<p>For he that shuts his eyes when he should see,</p>
<p>Willingly, let him not thrive, for me!’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth the fox, ‘may God give him mischance</p>
<p>Who is so careless of his governance,</p>
<p>And chatters when he should hold his peace!’</p>
<p>Lo, such it is to be reckless indeed,</p>
<p>And negligent, and trust in flattery!</p>
<p>But you that think this tale but a folly,</p>
<p>And all about a fox, and cock, and hen,</p>
<p>Take note of the moral, my good men.</p>
<p>For Saint Paul says all that written is,</p>
<p>For our understanding’s written, as is this,</p>
<p>Take the grain, and leave the chaff there still.</p>
<p>Now, gracious God, if it should be thy will</p>
<p>(As said my Lord), so make us all good men,</p>
<p>And bring us to the heights of bliss! Amen.</p>

<p>‘Sir Nun’s Priest,’ our Host said right anon,</p>
<p>‘Blessed be your breeches, and each stone!</p>
<p>That was a merry tale of Chanticleer.</p>
<p>But, by my troth, if you were a secular,</p>
<p>You would have been a treader of fowl alright;</p>
<p>For if you have spirit, as you have might,</p>
<p>Hens would be needed, is what I mean,</p>
<p>Yea, more than seven times seventeen!</p>
<p>See, what shoulders he has this gentle priest,</p>
<p>A solid neck and chest has there, at least!</p>
<p>He gazes like a sparrow hawk from those eyes;</p>
<p>For his complexion too he needs no dyes</p>
<p>Of Brazil-wood, or scarlet from Portugal.</p>
<p>Now sire, blessings on you for your tale!’</p>
<p>And after that, he, with full merry cheer,</p>
<p>Turned to another of us, as you’ll hear.</p>

<p>That servant and nurse unto our vices,</p>
<p>Which men call, in English, idleness,</p>
<p>The porter of the gate that men entices,</p>
<p>To eschew, and with its contrary oppress</p>
<p>– That is to say, through lawful business –</p>
<p>Well ought we to do, with true intent,</p>
<p>Lest the fiend through idleness snatch us hence.</p>
<p>For he, who with his thousand cords sly</p>
<p>Constantly waits us on the back to clap,</p>
<p>When a man in idleness he does spy,</p>
<p>Can all so easily catch him in his trap,</p>
<p>That till a man is caught by his coat-flap,</p>
<p>He’s unaware the fiend has him in hand!</p>
<p>We ought to work, and idleness withstand.</p>
<p>And even if men dreaded not to die,</p>
<p>Yet men might know by reason, doubtless,</p>
<p>The idle man’s a sluggard, plain to see,</p>
<p>And no increase comes from idleness,</p>
<p>And vile sloth does our lives compress</p>
<p>To mere sleeping, and to eat and drink,</p>
<p>Devouring all that others do and think.</p>
<p>And so to drive from us all idleness</p>
<p>That is the cause of such great confusion,</p>
<p>I have here wrought, through honest business,</p>
<p>After the legend, in my own translation,</p>
<p>Right of your glorious life and passion –</p>
<p>You with the crown twined of rose and lily all,</p>
<p>You I mean maid and martyr, Saint Cecilia.</p> 
<p>And you, who are the flower of virgins all,</p>
<p>Of whom Saint Bernard loves so to indite,</p>
<p>On you too, thus beginning, first I call;</p>
<p>You comfort of us wretches, help me cite</p>
<p>Your maiden’s death, who won through merit bright</p>
<p>Eternal life and, from the demon, victory,</p>
<p>As men may read, by following her story.</p>
<p>You maid and mother, daughter of your son,</p>
<p>You well of mercy, sinful souls’ cure,</p>
<p>In whom God chose to dwell, being one</p>
<p>Humblest yet highest over every creature,</p>
<p>You who thus ennobled so our nature</p>
<p>That He did not disdain, who made mankind,</p>
<p>His son in flesh and blood to clothe and wind.</p>
<p>Within the blissful cloister of your sides</p>
<p>Eternal Love took on man’s shape, that Peace</p>
<p>Who of the Three Worlds lord and guide is,</p>
<p>Whom earth, sea, and heaven, without cease,</p>
<p>Ever worship: and you, virgin stainless,</p>
<p>Bore of your body, and yet still maiden pure,</p>
<p>This Creator of every creature.</p>
<p>Assembled, in you, is magnificence</p>
<p>Mercy and goodness, with such pity</p>
<p>That you, who are the sun of excellence,</p>
<p>Not only help those who pray to thee,</p>
<p>But oftentimes, in your benignity,</p>
<p>Full freely, before men your help beseech,</p>
<p>You go before them, and are their life’s leech.</p> 
<p>Now help me, meek and blissful fair maid,</p>
<p>A wretch in exile in this desert of gall!</p>
<p>Think of the Canaanite woman who said</p>
<p>That whelps may eat some of the crumbs all</p>
<p>From their master’s table that do fall.</p>
<p>And though an unworthy scion I, of Eve,</p>
<p>And sinful, accept my faith, for I believe.</p>
<p>And, since faith is dead without works,</p>
<p>That I may work, grant me wit and space,</p>
<p>So I am quit of what in darkness lurks.</p>
<p>Be my advocate in that high place</p>
<p>Where without end is sung ‘Hosanna’,</p>
<p>You, Christ’s mother, daughter of Saint Anna.</p>
<p>And my soul in prison illuminate,</p>
<p>That burdened is by the contagion</p>
<p>Of my body, and also by the weight</p>
<p>Of earthly lust and false affection.</p>
<p>O haven of refuge, O salvation</p>
<p>Of those who are in sorrow and distress,</p>
<p>Now help me my labour to address.</p>
<p>Yet I pray you, who read what I write,</p>
<p>Forgive me my lack of diligence,</p>
<p>Failing this story subtly to indite;</p>
<p>For I have taken all the words and sense,</p>
<p>From one who in holy reverence</p>
<p>Wrote the saint’s story and her legend,</p>
<p>And I pray you will my work amend.</p> 
<p>First I would the name of Saint Cecilia</p>
<p>Expound, as men may in her story read.</p>
<p>In English thus it means ‘Heaven’s lily’,</p>
<p>That is, pure chasteness of virginity;</p>
<p>Or, from the whiteness of her purity,</p>
<p>And green of conscience, and her good name</p>
<p>The sweet savour, ‘lily’ denotes the same.</p>
<p>Or Cecilia means ‘path for the blind’,</p>
<p>For she was an example, for our teaching.</p>
<p>Or else Cecilia, as I written find</p>
<p>Is made by a manner of conjoining</p>
<p>From ‘Heaven’ and ‘Leah’; so figuring</p>
<p>‘Heaven’ is there for thoughts of holiness,</p>
<p>And ‘Leah’ for her constant usefulness.</p>
<p>Cecilia may be formed too in this manner:</p>
<p>‘Lacking in blindness’, for her great light</p>
<p>Of sapience, and for her morals clear.</p>
<p>Or else, lo, comes this maiden’s name bright</p>
<p>From ‘Heaven’ and Greek ‘laos’, so might</p>
<p>Men her truly the ‘people’s heaven’ call,</p>
<p>An example of good and wise works all.</p>
<p>For ‘laos’ read ‘people’ I mean to say,</p>
<p>And just as men may in the heavens see</p>
<p>The sun and moon and stars every way,</p>
<p>So men, spiritually, in this maid free</p>
<p>Find of faith the magnanimity,</p>
<p>And the clearness whole of sapience,</p>
<p>And sundry works bright in excellence.</p> 
<p>And just as the philosophers do write</p>
<p>That heaven is swift, and round too, and burning,</p>
<p>So was fair Cecilia the white</p>
<p>Full swift and busy, ever the good working,</p>
<p>Rounded and whole in her persevering,</p>
<p>And burning ever in charity full bright.</p>
<p>Now have I told you all her name aright.</p>

<p>This maiden bright, Cecilia, as her life says,</p>
<p>Was of Roman stock, and of noble kind;</p>
<p>And from her cradle fostered in the faith</p>
<p>Of Christ, and bore His gospel in her mind.</p>
<p>She never ceased, as it is writ I find,</p>
<p>To pray, and her true God to love and dread,</p>
<p>Beseeching Him to guard her maidenhead.</p>
<p>And when this maid was given to a man</p>
<p>In wedlock, who was full young in age,</p>
<p>One who bore the name Valerian,</p>
<p>And the day was come for her marriage,</p>
<p>She, all devout and humble, in her courage,</p>
<p>Under her robe of gold that was full fair,</p>
<p>Had next her flesh a garment all of hair.</p>
<p>And while the church organ made melody,</p>
<p>Thus to God alone in her heart sang she:</p>
<p>‘O Lord, my soul and my body keep</p>
<p>Undefiled, lest I confounded be!’</p>
<p>And for His love that died upon a tree,</p>
<p>Every second and third day did she fast,</p>
<p>Saying her prayers while the day did last.</p>
<p>Night came, and to bed must she be gone,</p>
<p>With her husband, as is oft the manner;</p>
<p>And privately she said to him anon:</p>
<p>‘O sweet and well beloved spouse, my dear,</p>
<p>There is a thing, if you will only hear,</p>
<p>That to you I would dearly love to say,</p>
<p>If you will swear never this to betray.’</p> 
<p>Valerian solemnly to her did swear</p>
<p>That at no time, whatever it might be,</p>
<p>Would he ever, wantonly, betray her.</p>
<p>And then at first to him thus said she:</p>
<p>‘I have an angel then, one that loves me,</p>
<p>Who with great love, whether I wake or sleep,</p>
<p>Is always there my body for to keep.</p>
<p>And if he were to know, now take heed,</p>
<p>That you touched me in love or shamefully,</p>
<p>He right anon would take you in the deed,</p>
<p>And in your youth thus slain shall you be.</p>
<p>But if you, as you should, love me chastely,</p>
<p>He will love you too, for your chasteness,</p>
<p>And show to you all his joy and brightness.’</p>
<p>Valerian, disciplined to God’s fold,</p>
<p>Answered again: ‘So I may trust thee,</p>
<p>Let me see the angel, and him behold,</p>
<p>And if then it is an angel indeed,</p>
<p>Then will I do as you have asked me.</p>
<p>And if you love another, by my oath,</p>
<p>Right with this sword I will slay you both.’</p>
<p>Cecilia answered swiftly, in this wise:</p>
<p>‘If it’s your wish, the angel shall you see,</p>
<p>If you’ll believe in Christ, and be baptised.</p>
<p>Go forth on the Appian Way,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘And from this town walk but miles three,</p>
<p>And to the poor folk that do there dwell</p>
<p>Speak to them the words that I shall tell.</p> 
<p>Tell them I, Cecilia, you to them sent,</p>
<p>For them to show you good Urban the old,</p>
<p>On secret business, and with good intent.</p>
<p>And when you Saint Urban do behold,</p>
<p>Tell him the words that I to you have told.</p>
<p>And when he has purged away your sin,</p>
<p>Then you will see the angel: go, begin.’</p>
<p>Valerian is to the place swiftly gone,</p>
<p>And as he was told, by her discerning,</p>
<p>He finds this holy old Urban anon,</p>
<p>There, among the saint’s burials lurking.</p>
<p>And he anon, without tarrying,</p>
<p>Gives his message, and when he has it told,</p>
<p>Urban, for joy, his hands does uphold.</p>
<p> The tears from his eyes he then let fall.</p>
<p>‘Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Sower of chaste intent, shepherd of us all,</p>
<p>The fruit of this seed of chastity</p>
<p>You have sown in Cecilia, take to thee!</p>
<p>Lo, like a busy bee, that knows no guile,</p>
<p>Your thrall Cecilia serves you all the while!</p>
<p>For the spouse whom she wed but now</p>
<p>Full like a fierce lion, she sends him here</p>
<p>As meek as ever was any lamb, to Thou.’</p>
<p>And at his words anon there did appear</p>
<p>An old man, clad in white clothes clear,</p>
<p>With a gold-lettered book in his hand,</p>
<p>And before Valerian he took his stand.</p> 
<p>Valerian, as if dead, fell down from dread,</p>
<p>On seeing him: the old man raised him though,</p>
<p>And then from his book right thus he read:</p>
<p>‘One Lord, One Faith, one God alone;</p>
<p>One Christendom, and father of all also,</p>
<p>Above all, and over all, everywhere.’</p>
<p>These words all in gold written were.</p>
<p>When he had read this, then, said the old man:</p>
<p>‘Believe you this thing or no? – Say yea or nay!’</p>
<p>‘I believe all this thing,’ quoth Valerian,</p>
<p>‘For a truer thing than this, I dare well say,</p>
<p>Under the heavens, none believe or may.’</p>
<p>Then the old man vanished – he knew not where –</p>
<p>And Pope Urban baptised him then and there.</p>
<p>Valerian went home and found Cecilia</p>
<p>Who in his room with an angel did stand.</p>
<p>This angel had of roses and of lilies</p>
<p>Two coronals which he bore in hand.</p>
<p>And first to Cecilia, as I understand,</p>
<p>He gave the one, and after I may state</p>
<p>The other gave to Valerian, her mate.</p>
<p>‘With body chaste, and with unblemished thought,</p>
<p>Cherish these crowns forever, ‘quoth he.</p>
<p>‘From Paradise to you I have them brought;</p>
<p>Nevermore shall they fade, as you shall see,</p>
<p>Nor lose their sweet savour, trust in me,</p>
<p>Nor will any see them with their eyes</p>
<p>Unless chaste and shameful acts they despise.</p> 
<p>And you, Valerian, since you so soon</p>
<p>Assented to good counsel also,</p>
<p>Say what you wish, and you shall have it too.’</p>
<p>‘I have a brother,’ quoth Valerian ‘know,</p>
<p>That in this world I love no man so.</p>
<p>I pray you that my brother may have grace</p>
<p>To know the truth, as I do in this place.’</p>
<p>The angel said: ‘God favours such request,</p>
<p>And thus with the palm of martyrdom,</p>
<p>Both of you shall reach his blissful rest.’</p>
<p>And Tiburce his brother he bade come,</p>
<p>And when he the fragrance in the room</p>
<p>Perceived, that the roses and lilies cast,</p>
<p>He felt the heart within his breast beat fast,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I wonder, at this time of year,</p>
<p>Whence that sweet fragrance issues so</p>
<p>Of roses and lilies that I smell here!</p>
<p>Though I had them in my hands I know</p>
<p>The fragrance in me might no deeper go.</p>
<p>The sweet smell that in myself I find</p>
<p>Has changed me all in another kind.’</p>
<p>Valerian said: ‘Two coronals have we,</p>
<p>Snow white and rose red, shining clear,</p>
<p>Which no eyesight has the power to see;</p>
<p>And as you smell them, through prayer, here,</p>
<p>So shall you see them, my brother dear,</p>
<p>If you’ll believe, without delay, this proof</p>
<p>Aright, and acknowledge the very truth.’</p> 
<p>Tiburce answered: ‘Say you this to me,</p>
<p>In reality, or do I dream all this?</p>
<p>‘In dreams, ‘quoth Valerian,’ have we</p>
<p>Been until now, brother mine, now is</p>
<p>Our dwelling place in truth and in bliss.’</p>
<p>‘How know you this?’ quoth Tiburce, ‘in what wise?’</p>
<p>Quoth Valerian: ‘Of that I shall advise.</p>
<p>The angel of God has the truth so taught,</p>
<p>Which you shall see, if you will forsake</p>
<p>The idols and be chaste, or else see naught.’</p>
<p>– And of the miracle of these crowns you may</p>
<p>Hear in Saint Ambrose’ Preface, I say;</p>
<p>Solemnly that noble Doctor dear</p>
<p>Commends it, and speaks in this manner here:</p>
<p>‘The palm of martyrdom for to receive,</p>
<p>Saint Cecilia, filled full of God’s grace,</p>
<p>Her chamber and the world itself did leave.</p>
<p>Witness Tiburce and Valerian’s faith,</p>
<p>To whom God in his bounty, gave apace,</p>
<p>Twin coronals of flowers sweet smelling,</p>
<p>And had to them his angel the crowns bring.</p>
<p>The maid had brought these men to bliss above;</p>
<p>The world has learnt the worth, for certain,</p>
<p>Of devotion to chastity in love.’</p>
<p>This Cecilia showed, openly and plain</p>
<p>And that all idols are but things in vain,</p>
<p>For they are dumb, and deaf, to deceive,</p>
<p>And she charged men idols for to leave.’</p> 
<p>‘Whoever knows not this, a beast he is’</p>
<p>Quoth Tiburce, ‘and let me tell no lie.’</p>
<p>And Cecilia kissed him hearing this,</p>
<p>And was full glad he could the truth espy.</p>
<p>‘This day are we as kinfolk now allied,’</p>
<p>Said then the blissful fair maiden dear,</p>
<p>And after that she spoke as you shall hear:</p>
<p>‘Lo, just as the love of Christ,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘Made me your brother’s wife, in that same wise</p>
<p>Anon for my kinsman here take I thee,</p>
<p>Since idolatry you do despise.</p>
<p>Go with your brother now and be baptised,</p>
<p>And make yourself chaste, that you may behold</p>
<p>The angel’s face of which your brother told.’</p>
<p>Tiburce answered and said: ‘Brother dear,</p>
<p>First tell me where to go, and to what man.’</p>
<p>‘To whom?’ quoth he, ‘Come, with right good cheer;</p>
<p>And I will lead you there, to Pope Urban’</p>
<p>‘To Urban, brother mine, Valerian?’</p>
<p>Quoth Tiburce: ‘Will you thither lead?</p>
<p>That would be a wondrous thing indeed!</p>
<p>‘You cannot mean Urban, he who has so</p>
<p>Often been condemned, he should be dead,</p>
<p>Who lives in hiding, wandering to and fro,</p>
<p>And from hiding dare not put out his head?</p>
<p>For men would burn him in a fire so red</p>
<p>If he were found, or men might him spy,</p>
<p>And we too, in his company, would die!</p> 
<p>And while we seek for that divinity</p>
<p>That is concealed in heaven secretly,</p>
<p>We shall be burnt in this world, I see.’</p>
<p>To which Cecilia said courageously:</p>
<p>‘Men would fear rightly, indeed, and wisely,</p>
<p>To lose this life, my own dear brother,</p>
<p>If this were the only life, and no other.</p>
<p>But there’s a better life in another place,</p>
<p>That never shall be lost, fear you naught,</p>
<p>Which God’s Son told us of, in His grace.</p>
<p>The Father’s Son has all things wrought,</p>
<p>And all that’s wrought with rational thought</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost, from the Father proceeding,</p>
<p>Has endowed with souls: this we believe in.</p>
<p>By word and by miracle, He, God’s Son,</p>
<p>When He was in the world, declared here</p>
<p>That there was another life yet to be won.’</p>
<p>To which answered Tiburce: ‘Sister dear,</p>
<p>Did you not speak just now, in this manner:</p>
<p>There is but one God, Lord, in truthfulness?</p>
<p>How then to three may you bear witness?’</p>
<p>‘This I’ll explain, ‘quoth she, ‘ere I go.</p>
<p>Just as men have intelligences three –</p>
<p>Memory, invention, reason also –</p>
<p>So in one being, one divinity,</p>
<p>Three persons there may easily be.’</p>
<p>Then she began busily to preach</p>
<p>Of Christ’s coming, and His Pains did teach,</p> 
<p>And many details too of His Passion –</p>
<p>How God’s Son this world in bonds did hold</p>
<p>To win Mankind complete remission,</p>
<p>That was bound in sin and cares cold –</p>
<p>All these things, to Tiburce she told.</p>
<p>And after this, Tiburce, with good intent,</p>
<p>With Valerian, he to Pope Urban went,</p>
<p>Urban thanked God; and with glad heart and light</p>
<p>Baptised him, and made him in that place</p>
<p>Perfect in his knowledge, God’s own knight.</p>
<p>And after this, Tiburce knew such grace</p>
<p>That every day he saw, in time and space,</p>
<p>The angel of God; and every kind of boon</p>
<p>He asked of God was granted him full soon.</p>
<p>It would be hard in sequence to relate</p>
<p>How many wonders Jesus for them wrought.</p>
<p>But at the last, brief and plain to state,</p>
<p>The sergeant of the town of Rome them sought,</p>
<p>And him to Almachius, the Prefect, brought,</p>
<p>Who questioned them and knew all their intent,</p>
<p>And to the statue of Jupiter them sent,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Whoever will not sacrifice,</p>
<p>Cut off his head! This is my sentence here.’</p>
<p>Anon these martyrs of whom I advise,</p>
<p>One Maximus, who was an officer</p>
<p>And an adjutant in the Prefecture,</p>
<p>Took them, and when he forth the saints led,</p>
<p>He himself wept for pity, it is said.</p> 
<p>When Maximus had heard the saints’ lore,</p>
<p>Of the executioners he sought leave,</p>
<p>To lead them to his house, and before</p>
<p>Night fell, their preaching he did believe,</p>
<p>And the executioners also they freed,</p>
<p>And Maximus, and his household each one,</p>
<p>From the false faith, to trust in God alone.</p>
<p>Cecilia, when it was almost night,</p>
<p>With priests, to baptise them, did appear;</p>
<p>And afterwards, when it was almost light,</p>
<p>Cecilia said to them with steadfast cheer:</p>
<p>‘Now, Christ’s own knights, beloved and dear,</p>
<p>Cast away all the works of darkness,</p>
<p>And clad yourselves in armour of brightness.</p>
<p>You did, in truth, in mighty battle prevail.</p>
<p>Your course is run; your faith you have preserved.</p>
<p>Go to the crown of life that shall not fail!</p>
<p>The righteous Judge whom you have truly served</p>
<p>Shall grant it you, for you have so deserved.’</p>
<p>And when all this was said, as I advise,</p>
<p>Men led them forth, to make their sacrifice.</p>
<p>But when they were to the temple brought,</p>
<p>To tell you, all briefly, the conclusion,</p>
<p>Of sacrifice and incense they’d have naught, </p>
<p>But, praying, the bare ground they knelt upon,</p>
<p>With humble hearts and with sad devotion,</p>
<p>And both their heads were severed in that place,</p>
<p>Their souls departing to the King of Grace.</p> 
<p>Then Maximus, who saw it, testified</p>
<p>With piteous tears of what he’d seen aright,</p>
<p>That their souls did into heaven glide</p>
<p>With angels full of chastity and light;</p>
<p>And with his words converted men outright,</p>
<p>For which Almachius with whips did beat</p>
<p>Him, leaded thongs, till he with death did meet.</p>
<p>Cecilia took and buried him anon,</p>
<p>Near Tiburce and Valerian, gently,</p>
<p>Within her burial-place beneath a stone.</p>
<p>And after this Almachius swiftly</p>
<p>Bade his officers fetch openly</p>
<p>Cecilia, so that in his presence</p>
<p>She might sacrifice to Jove, with incense.</p>
<p>But they, converted by her wise lore,</p>
<p>Wept full sore, and gave full credence</p>
<p>To her words, and cried out more and more,</p>
<p>‘Christ, God’s Son, between them no difference</p>
<p>Is God indeed – this is the thought and sense</p>
<p>Of the good servant, she who Him does serve!</p>
<p>This with one voice we swear, and will not swerve.’</p>
<p>Almachius, who heard of all this doing,</p>
<p>Bade them bring Cecilia, that he might see;</p>
<p>And first of all, lo, this was his questioning:</p>
<p>‘What manner of woman are you?’ quoth he.</p>
<p>‘I am a gentlewoman born,’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘I ask,’ quoth he, ‘though it may bring you grief,</p>
<p>You of your religion, and your belief.’</p> 
<p>‘You have begun to question foolishly,’</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘who would two points include</p>
<p>In one demand; you have asked stupidly.’</p>
<p>Almachius his questioning pursued:</p>
<p>‘Whence comes this reply, which is so rude?’</p>
<p>‘Whence?’ quoth she, her answer unrestrained,</p>
<p>‘From conscience and from a faith unfeigned.’</p>
<p>Almachius said: ‘Do you then take no heed</p>
<p>Of my power?’ And she answered like this:</p>
<p>‘Your might,’ quoth she, ‘is naught for me to dread,</p>
<p>For every mortal man’s power is</p>
<p>But like a bladder full of wind, but kiss</p>
<p>It with a needle’s point, as you well know,</p>
<p>And all its greatness will be laid full low.’</p>
<p>‘Full wrongfully have you begun,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘And still in wrong show your perseverance!</p>
<p>Do you not know our mighty princes free</p>
<p>Have thus commanded, and made ordinance,</p>
<p>That every Christian shall do penance,</p>
<p>Unless his Christianity he gainsay,</p>
<p>But go scot free yet, if he will renege?’</p>
<p>‘Your princes err, as your great nobles do,’</p>
<p>Quoth Cecilia, ‘for with foolish sentence</p>
<p>You call us guilty, yet it is not true;</p>
<p>For you, who know well our innocence,</p>
<p>Inasmuch as we show our reverence</p>
<p>For Christ, and bear a Christian name,</p>
<p>You charge us with a crime, us seek to blame.</p> 
<p>But we who understand that name as though</p>
<p>It were all virtue, may not it gainsay.’</p>
<p>Almachius answered her: ‘Choose so:</p>
<p>Make the sacrifice, or renege, I say,</p>
<p>You may yet escape death in that way.’</p>
<p>At which the holy blissful fair maid</p>
<p>Began to laugh, and to the judge she said:</p>
<p>‘O Judge, confused you are, in your folly!</p>
<p>Do you think I would deny my innocence,</p>
<p>And render myself thus wicked?’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘Lo, he dissimulates before an audience!</p>
<p>He restrains himself yet rages lost to sense,</p>
<p>Inwardly.’ Almachius answered:  ‘Wretch,</p>
<p>Do you not know how far my powers stretch?</p>
<p>Did not to me our mighty princes give,</p>
<p>Yea, both the power and authority</p>
<p>To sentence folk to die or to live?</p>
<p>Why speak so proudly then to me?’</p>
<p>‘I only spoke steadfastly,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘Not proudly; for I say, those on our side,</p>
<p>All hate in truth the deadly vice of pride.</p>
<p>And if you dread not the truth to hear,</p>
<p>Then will I show all openly, by right,</p>
<p>That you have made a false error here.</p>
<p>You say the princes granted you your might</p>
<p>Both to slay men or grant them life outright.</p>
<p>You may only men of life bereave,</p>
<p>You have no other powers, nor no leave.</p> 
<p>Thus you may say the princes have so made</p>
<p>You minister of death; but if you speak also</p>
<p>Of life, you lie, such power’s nowhere displayed.’</p>
<p>‘Quench your boldness,’ said Almachius, ‘Go,</p>
<p>Sacrifice to our gods, I order so.</p>
<p>I care not what insults to me you offer,</p>
<p>For I can suffer them, as a philosopher:</p>
<p>But this foul insult I may not endure</p>
<p>That you level at our gods,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>Cecilia answered: ‘Foolish creature,</p>
<p>Not a single word have you said to me,</p>
<p>That did not betray your rank folly,</p>
<p>And that you are in every way there is</p>
<p>An ignorant official, a vain justice.</p>
<p>There is every sign in your outer eye</p>
<p>Of blindness; for a dumb thing, that all</p>
<p>Can see is stone – and you as well as I –</p>
<p>That same stone a deity you would call.</p>
<p>I counsel you, there let your own hand fall,</p>
<p>And feel it well, mere stone there will you find,</p>
<p>Since you cannot see it’s so, with eyes all blind.</p>
<p>Shameful for you that the people shall</p>
<p>So scorn you, and laugh at your folly, ay,</p>
<p>For men know here, as truly as do all,</p>
<p>That mighty God is in the heavens high,</p>
<p>And these statues, if you had the eyes,</p>
<p>To you, as to themselves, bring no profit,</p>
<p>Not worth a groat, they show no benefit.’</p> 
<p>These words, and others like them, said she;</p>
<p>And he was angered, and bade her be lead</p>
<p>Home to her house, ‘and in her house,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Burn her outright in a bath of flames red.’</p>
<p>And it was done, precisely as he said,</p>
<p>For in a bath they shut her, and the glow</p>
<p>Of a great fire burned night and day below.</p>
<p>All a long night, and for a day also,</p>
<p>Despite the fire, and the bath’s great heat,</p>
<p>She sat all cold, and felt no touch of woe,</p>
<p>Nor one drop of sweat, from head to feet.</p>
<p>Yet in that bath her death she must meet,</p>
<p>For he Almachius, with base intent,</p>
<p>His man, to slay her in the bath, he sent.</p>
<p>Three strokes in the neck he smote her so,</p>
<p>Her executioner; yet by no chance</p>
<p>Could he smite her neck in two, all know.</p>
<p>And as at that time there was an ordinance</p>
<p>That no man should a further stroke advance</p>
<p>Whether to smite a fourth time, soft or sore,</p>
<p>The executioner dared do no more,</p>
<p>But half dead, with her neck carven there,</p>
<p>Left her lying, and on his way he went.</p>
<p>The Christian folk, who about her were,</p>
<p>With sheets the flow of blood did quench.</p>
<p>Three days she lived on, in this torment,</p>
<p>And never ceased them the faith to teach</p>
<p>That she had fostered; and so did preach,</p> 
<p>And entrusted them with all her things,</p>
<p>And to the Pope Urban bequeathed them so,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I ask this of Heaven’s King,</p>
<p>Respite for three days, ere I go,</p>
<p>To commend them to you, these souls, lo,</p>
<p>And that I might begin a holy work</p>
<p>Making my house a perpetual church.’</p>
<p>Saint Urban, and his deacons, secretly,</p>
<p>Took up her body, buried it by night</p>
<p>Among the other saints, all reverently.</p>
<p>Her house, the Church of Saint Cecilia bright,</p>
<p>Saint Urban consecrated, as was his right;</p>
<p>In which, unto this day, in noble wise,</p>
<p>Men still do service to the saint and Christ. </p>

<p>When ended was the life of Saint Cecilia,</p>
<p>Ere we had ridden fully five miles further,</p>
<p>At Boughton-under-Blean rode up a hack</p>
<p>With a man clothed in black upon its back,</p>
<p>Who underneath had on a white surplice.</p>
<p>His hack, a dappled grey, all sweating is,</p>
<p>Sweating so hard it is a sight to see;</p>
<p>It looks as if he has galloped miles three.</p>
<p>Also the horse his yeoman rode upon</p>
<p>Sweated so, it could barely trot on.</p>
<p>About the saddle straps the foam stood high;</p>
<p>With foam it was all flecked like a magpie.</p>
<p>A doubled wallet on its crupper lay;</p>
<p>It seemed that he carried slight array,</p>
<p>All light, for summer, rode this worthy man.</p>
<p>And in my mind to wonder I began</p>
<p>What he might be, until I understood,</p>
<p>Since his cloak was sewn onto his hood,</p>
<p>After I’d reflected a while, that he</p>
<p>A regular canon of the church must be.</p>
<p>His hat hung at his back down by a lace,</p>
<p>For he had ridden at a lively pace:</p>
<p>He had been galloping as he were mad.</p>
<p>And a dock-leaf under his hood he had,</p>
<p>For sweat, and to keep his head from heat.</p>
<p>It was a joy to see him sweat so neat!</p>
<p>His forehead shed drops like a distillery,</p>
<p>A still for plantain-juice and pellitory.</p>
<p>And when he arrived, he cried full loudly:</p>
<p>‘God save,’ quoth he, ‘this jolly company!</p>
<p>Fast I have ridden,’ quoth he, for your sake,</p>
<p>Because I wished you folk to overtake,</p>
<p>And ride with all this merry company.’</p>
<p>His yeoman too was full of courtesy,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Sires, but now at morning-tide,</p>
<p>Out of your hostelry I saw you ride,</p>
<p>And made aware my lord and sovereign,</p>
<p>Who was eager your company to gain</p>
<p>For his amusement; he loves dalliance.’</p>
<p>‘Friend, for your trouble God give you good chance!’</p>
<p>Then said our Host: ‘– for, certain, it would seem</p>
<p>Your lord is wise, wisdom I would it deem.</p>
<p>He is full jocund also, I dare say!</p>
<p>Can he tell a merry tale or two, in play,</p>
<p>To gladden all this company, say I?’</p>
<p>‘Who, sir: my lord? Yes, yes, without a lie!</p>
<p>He knows of mirth, and also jollity,</p>
<p>More than enough; also, sire, trust me,</p>
<p>If you but knew him half so well as I,</p>
<p>You’d be amazed how well he can vie</p>
<p>With all, in work, and that in sundry wise.</p>
<p>He has dealt with many an enterprise,</p>
<p>That would be hard for any that is here</p>
<p>To bring about, unless he were to steer.</p>
<p>As homely as he may look among you,</p>
<p>It would benefit you, that him you knew.</p>
<p>You would not forego his acquaintance</p>
<p>For all your goods, I’d set in the balance</p>
<p>All that I have in my possession!</p>
<p>He is a man of great discretion;</p>
<p>I advise you, he’s an excellent man.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ quoth our Host, ‘I pray you, tell on,</p>
<p>Is he a cleric, or no? Say what he is.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, to be greater than a clerk is this,’</p>
<p>Said the Yeoman, ‘in a few words or so,</p>
<p>Host, of his craft something I would show.</p>
<p>I say, my lord such subtle skills has he –</p>
<p>Yet all his craft you cannot learn from me</p>
<p>Although I help him somewhat in its working –</p>
<p>That all this ground over which we’re riding,</p>
<p>Until we come to Canterbury town,</p>
<p>He could turn it all clean upside-down,</p>
<p>And pave it all with silver and with gold.’</p>
<p>And when the Yeoman had this story told</p>
<p>To our Host, he cried, ‘Benedicitee!</p>
<p>It then seems wondrous marvellous to me –</p>
<p>Since your lord is of such high sapience,</p>
<p>And all men should hold him in reverence –</p>
<p>That his own dignity he treats so light.</p>
<p>His cassock now is scarcely worth a mite,</p>
<p>In truth, I’d say, to him, God bless my soul!</p>
<p>It’s dirty through and through, and torn also.</p>
<p>Why is your lord so slovenly, I pray?</p>
<p>– Yet has the means to buy better any day,</p>
<p>If his deeds accord with all your speech.</p>
<p>Tell me that, for so I do you beseech!’</p>
<p>Quoth the Yeoman, ‘Why go asking me?</p>
<p>God help me so, but he’ll not prosper thee!</p>
<p>– I can’t acknowledge anything I say,</p>
<p>And therefore keep the secret now, I pray –</p>
<p>But he’s too wise, so I believe, in truth.</p>
<p>Whatever is in excess, will never prove</p>
<p>Useful, as the clerics say; it’s a vice.</p>
<p>So that in this I hold him foolish twice;</p>
<p>For when a man has far too great a wit,</p>
<p>Often it happens he misuses it.</p>
<p>So does my lord: and it grieves me sore.</p>
<p>God amend it! I can explain no more.’</p>
<p>‘No matter, my good Yeoman’ quoth our Host;</p>
<p>But since of the cunning of your lord you boast,</p>
<p>Say what he does, I pray you heartily,</p>
<p>Since he works so well and skilfully.</p>
<p>Where do you dwell, if told such may be?’</p>
<p>‘In the suburbs of a town,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Lurking in holes and corners, alleys blind,</p>
<p>Where robbers, and thieves of every kind,</p>
<p>Fearful, keep their private residence,</p>
<p>As those do who daren’t show their presence.</p>
<p>So do we fare, if I must tell the truth.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ quoth our Host, ‘let me ask of you.</p>
<p>Why are you so discoloured round the face?’</p>
<p>‘Peter!’ quoth he, ‘God shows it little grace,</p>
<p>I am forced so oft the flames to blow</p>
<p>That is has altered my whole colour so.</p>
<p>In the mirror I’m hardly wont to pry,</p>
<p>But labour hard: and alchemy I try.</p>
<p>We blunder ever, poring o’er the fire,</p>
<p>Yet for all that, we fail of our desire,</p>
<p>For we never reach the right conclusion.</p>
<p>On many folk we practice pure illusion,</p>
<p>And borrow gold – be it a pound or two,</p>
<p>Or ten, or twelve, more if we’re able to –</p>
<p>And make them think, in whatever way,</p>
<p>That from a pound we can make two: I say</p>
<p>It is all falsehood; but we live in hope</p>
<p>Of success: and after it we grope,</p>
<p>But the science runs so far before</p>
<p>We cannot, despite the oath we swore,</p>
<p>Overtake it; it glides away so fast.</p>
<p>It will leave us beggars at the last.’</p>
<p>While the Yeoman thus went on talking,</p>
<p>The Canon, drawing near, heard everything</p>
<p>That the Yeoman said; for great suspicion</p>
<p>Of men’s speech ever had this Canon.</p>
<p>For Cato says, that he who guilty is</p>
<p>Thinks all men speak of him, as in this.</p>
<p>That was the reason he so near did draw</p>
<p>To his Yeoman, to eavesdrop all the more.</p>
<p>And then he spoke unto his Yeoman, so:</p>
<p>‘Hold your peace and speak not, I say no!</p>
<p>For if you do, you’ll pay for it full dearly.</p>
<p>You’re slandering me to all this company,</p>
<p>Revealing also things that you should hide.’</p>
<p>‘Yet,’ quoth our Host, ‘tell on whate’er betide!</p>
<p>And all his threats reckon them not a fly.’</p>
<p>‘By my faith,’ quoth he, ‘no more shall I.’</p>
<p>And when the Canon saw that it must be,</p>
<p>And the Yeoman dispense with privacy,</p>
<p>He fled away, for very sorrow and shame.</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ quoth the Yeoman, ‘now begins a game!</p>
<p>All that I know, anon now I will tell,</p>
<p>Since he’s gone – fiends whisk him off to Hell!</p>
<p>For never hereafter with him will I visit,</p>
<p>For a penny or a pound, so I swear it.</p>
<p>He that brought me first to that foul game,</p>
<p>Before he dies, sorrow on him, and shame!</p>
<p>For all is serious to me, in faith.</p>
<p>That I feel whatever any man sayeth.</p>
<p>And despite the pain, and all my grief,</p>
<p>Despite my sorrow, labour, and mischief,</p>
<p>I could never forsake it in any wise.</p>
<p>Now would God my wits might suffice</p>
<p>To tell you all belonging to that art!</p>
<p>Yet, nonetheless, I will tell you part;</p>
<p>Since my lord is gone, no details spare.</p>
<p>Whatever of it I know, I shall declare.’</p>

<p>With this Canon I’ve dwelt for seven years,</p>
<p>Yet his science no clearer to me appears.</p>
<p>And all that I have had, I’ve lost thereby,</p>
<p>As, God knows, have many more than I!</p>
<p>Where I was wont to be right fresh each day</p>
<p>In clothing, and in other fine array,</p>
<p>Now I must wear my hose upon my head;</p>
<p>And where my colour was both fresh and red,</p>
<p>Now is it wan and of a leaden hue.</p>
<p>Whoso employs it, bitterly shall he rue!</p>
<p>And bleared yet from labour is my eye.</p>
<p>Lo, what a game it is to ‘multiply’!</p>
<p>The slippery science renders me so bare</p>
<p>I gain no profit, wherever I may fare.</p>
<p>And yet I am so much in debt thereby,</p>
<p>With the gold that I have borrowed, I,</p>
<p>While I live, may yet repay it never.</p>
<p>Let every man be warned by me forever!</p>
<p>Whichever man applies himself thereto,</p>
<p>His luck is over, if he dare continue.</p>
<p>So help me God, nothing thereby he’ll win,</p>
<p>But empty his purse, and make his wits thin.</p>
<p>And when he, through his madness and folly,</p>
<p>Has placed his own wealth in jeopardy,</p>
<p>Then he’ll excite other folks thereto</p>
<p>To lose their own wealth, as he must do.</p>
<p>For to villains a joy it is, and does please,</p>
<p>To see others suffer pain and disease.</p>
<p>– Thus I was once informed by a clerk.</p>
<p>Of that no matter; I’ll speak of our work.</p>
<p>When we had found a place to exercise</p>
<p>Our elvish craft, we appeared wondrous wise;</p>
<p>Our language was so technical and quaint.</p>
<p>I blew the fire till I was fit to faint.</p>
<p>Why should I tell you every proportion</p>
<p>Of all the substances we worked upon?</p>
<p>– Such as, five or six ounces, it may be,</p>
<p>Of silver, or some other quantity –</p>
<p>Or busy myself to tell you all the names,</p>
<p>Arsenic sulphides, burnt bone, iron grains,</p>
<p>All into powder ground, and rendered small;</p>
<p>And how in an earthen pot we put it all,</p>
<p>And put in salt, a sprinkling of pepper,</p>
<p>Before the powders that I speak of, covered</p>
<p>The whole thing with a vessel made of glass;</p>
<p>And many another thing which there was;</p>
<p>And with clay the pots and glasses sealing,</p>
<p>That, of the air, might pass out nothing;</p>
<p>And of the slow fire, and hot also,</p>
<p>Which we made, and all the care and woe</p>
<p>We took with our materials’ sublimation,</p>
<p>And in calcination and amalgamation</p>
<p>Of quicksilver, called mercury indeed?</p>
<p>For all our tricks we could not succeed.</p>
<p>Our arsenic sulphides, sublimated mercury,</p>
<p>Our lead oxides ground down fine on porphyry;</p>
<p>Of each of these some ounces went for certain –</p>
<p>Nothing helped; we laboured all in vain!</p>
<p>Neither the vapours in their ascension,</p>
<p>Nor the solids left settling all adown</p>
<p>Did in our workings anything avail,</p>
<p>For lost was all our labour and travail.</p>
<p>And all the cost, all gone the devil’s way,</p>
<p>Was lost also, whatever we had to pay.</p>
<p>There is also many another thing</p>
<p>To mention, to our craft appertaining,</p>
<p>Though I can’t by rote rehearse the plan,</p>
<p>For truly I was never a learned man.</p>
<p>Yet I will speak them as they come to mind,</p>
<p>Though I can’t enumerate them by kind:</p>
<p>– Such as Armenian clay, verdigris, borax,</p>
<p>And sundry vessels made of earth and glass,</p>
<p>Our urinals, our pots for distillation,</p>
<p>Phials, crucibles, pots for sublimation,</p>
<p>Of gourd-retorts, and alembics I speak,</p>
<p>And other such, all hardly worth a leek –</p>
<p>I’ve no need to rehearse them all –</p>
<p>Waters for reddening metals, bull’s gall,</p>
<p>Arsenic, sal ammoniac, and brimstone;</p>
<p>And herbs I might mention, many a one</p>
<p>– As moonwort, valerian, agrimony,</p>
<p>And other such, if I should choose to tarry.</p>
<p>Our vessels glowing bright, both night and day,</p>
<p>To bring about our purpose, if we may;</p>
<p>Our furnaces too for calcination,</p>
<p>And waters for the albification;</p>
<p>Un-slaked lime, chalk and egg-white, say,</p>
<p>Powders diverse, ashes, dung, piss and clay,</p>
<p>Waxed bags, saltpetre, vitriol,</p>
<p>And diverse fires made of wood and coal;</p>
<p>Tartar, alkali, salt preparation,</p>
<p>And combust matters in coagulation;</p>
<p>Clay made with horse or human hair, and oil</p>
<p>Of tartar, potash of alum, yeast, argoile,</p>
<p>Realgar, unfermented beer, moistening</p>
<p>Matter, matter for our compounding,</p>
<p>And for our silver’s citrination,</p>
<p>Our testing by heat, our fermentation,</p>
<p>Our ingots, vessels for assay, and so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you, as was taught to me, also,</p>
<p>Of the four spirits and the bodies seven,</p>
<p>In order, as I heard my master give them:</p>
<p>The first spirit’s quicksilver, in the list;</p>
<p>The second arsenic sulphide; the third is</p>
<p>Sal ammoniac, and the fourth brimstone.</p>
<p>The bodies seven too, lo here anon:</p>
<p>Sol gold is, and Luna’s silver, all;</p>
<p>Mars iron, Mercury quicksilver we call;</p>
<p>Saturn is lead, and Jupiter is tin,</p>
<p>And Venus copper, by my father’s kin.</p>
<p>Who this wretched craft shall exercise,</p>
<p>Shall have no wealth from it that may suffice,</p>
<p>For all the wealth he spends thereabout</p>
<p>Shall he lose; of that I have no doubt.</p>
<p>Who would reveal his folly, so say I,</p>
<p>Let him come forth and learn to ‘multiply’.</p>
<p>And every man with aught in his coffer,</p>
<p>Let him appear and play philosopher,</p>
<p>If to the craft it’s easy to aspire!</p>
<p>Nay, nay, God knows, be it monk or friar,</p>
<p>Priest or canon on whom the wish should light,</p>
<p>Though he sit at his books both day and night</p>
<p>Studying this foolish elvish lore,</p>
<p>All is in vain – and, in faith, it’s more</p>
<p>Vain teaching a layman all this subtlety!</p>
<p>Fie! Speak not of it, no way shall it be.</p>
<p>Whether he knows his letters, or knows none,</p>
<p>The effect’s the same, he’ll find it all one;</p>
<p>For either of the two, by my salvation,</p>
<p>Achieve the same at alchemy’s mutation,</p>
<p>Whatever ‘multiplying’ they may do,</p>
<p>That is to say, they fail: both the two.</p>
<p>Still have I forgotten my rehearsal</p>
<p>Of corrosive liquids, and of metal,</p>
<p>And of bodies’ mollification,</p>
<p>And also of their induration,</p>
<p>Oils, ablutions, and metal fusible –</p>
<p>To tell it all’s beyond any bible</p>
<p>Anywhere; and so, and for the best,</p>
<p>From all these names I’ll take a rest.</p>
<p>It seems to me, enough I’ve told you now</p>
<p>To raise a fiend, one fierce enough I vow.</p>
<p>Ah, nay, let be! The philosopher’s stone,</p>
<p>Called the elixir, we seek it every one,</p>
<p>For had we it, we’d be secure, and how.</p>
<p>Yet to the God of Heaven I will avow,</p>
<p>For all our skill, when the work is through,</p>
<p>Despite our wit, still is there all to do.</p>
<p>It tempted us to spend our worldly good,</p>
<p>For sorrow of which go mad we should,</p>
<p>Except that hope still creeps about our heart,</p>
<p>Dreaming ever, despite our bitter smart,</p>
<p>Of being eased by profit, afterward.</p>
<p>Such dreaming, and such hope dies hard;</p>
<p>I warn you, you’ll seek for it forever.</p>
<p>That future hope makes madmen sever,</p>
<p>By trusting it, from all they ever had;</p>
<p>Yet the art can never make them sad,</p>
<p>For to them it is still bitter-sweet.</p>
<p>So it seems – for have they but a sheet,</p>
<p>In which to wrap themselves of a night,</p>
<p>And a coarse cloak to walk in, by daylight,</p>
<p>They will sell them, and spend it on the craft.</p>
<p>They cannot cease till nothing’s left, alas.</p>
<p>And evermore, wherever they choose to go,</p>
<p>By that brimstone smell, men may them know.</p>
<p>For all the world, they stink like goats, the lot!</p>
<p>The smell they give off is so rank and hot</p>
<p>That though a man a mile from them may be,</p>
<p>The smell will still infect him yet, trust me.</p>
<p>Thus by the smell, and their threadbare array,</p>
<p>If men wish recognise these folk they may.</p>
<p>And if a man will ask them privately</p>
<p>Why they clothe themselves so shabbily,</p>
<p>They right anon will whisper in his ear,</p>
<p>And say that if they discovered were</p>
<p>Men would slay them, because of their science.</p>
<p>Lo, thus these folk trade on innocence!</p>
<p>Pass over this; I go my tale unto.</p>
<p>Ere that the pot be on the fire anew,</p>
<p>Metals in specific quantity,</p>
<p>My lord tempers, and no man but he –</p>
<p>Now he is gone, I dare say it boldly –</p>
<p>For, as men say, he works skilfully</p>
<p>(At any rate, I know he’s earned a name),</p>
<p>And yet he often blunders just the same.</p>
<p>Know you how? Full oft it happens so,</p>
<p>The pot breaks, and then there’s naught to show!</p>
<p>These metals are of such great violence,</p>
<p>Our walls provide but limited resistance,</p>
<p>Unless they are wrought of lime and stone.</p>
<p>They pierce so, and through the wall are gone,</p>
<p>And some of them sink straight into the ground –</p>
<p>Thus have we lost sometimes many a pound –</p>
<p>And some are scattered all the floor about,</p>
<p>Some leap up to the roof. Without a doubt,</p>
<p>Though to our sight the fiend won’t show,</p>
<p>I think he’s with us, that foul so and so!</p>
<p>In Hell, where he is the lord and sire,</p>
<p>There’s no more woe, or rancour, or ire,</p>
<p>Than when our pot breaks, as I have said;</p>
<p>Everyone chides, pours insults on our head.</p>
<p>Some say it was faulty fire-making;</p>
<p>Some say nay, it was faulty blowing;</p>
<p>Then I’m a-feared, since that’s my office.</p>
<p>‘Straw!’ says a third, ‘You’re foolish twice!</p>
<p>It wasn’t tempered as it ought to be!</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ says a fourth, ‘hearken unto me.</p>
<p>Because the fire wasn’t made of beech,</p>
<p>That’s the cause, and none other, I teach!’</p>
<p>I’ve no idea where the thing went wrong,</p>
<p>But well I know great strife is us among.</p>
<p>‘Well!’ says my lord, ‘No more can be done.</p>
<p>I’ll be more careful in time to come.</p>
<p>I’m certain now that the pot was crazed.</p>
<p>Be it as it may, be not dismayed;</p>
<p>As we do, sweep the floor, swift and lithe.</p>
<p>Pluck up your courage, be glad and blithe!’</p>
<p>The rubbish in a heap is swept, alas,</p>
<p>And over the floor a piece of canvas cast,</p>
<p>And all the rubbish in a sieve is thrown,</p>
<p>And sifted, and picked over like a bone.</p>
<p>‘By my faith,’ says one, ‘some of our metal</p>
<p>Is here yet, although we have not it all.</p>
<p>And though the thing has failed us for now,</p>
<p>Another time it may go well, I vow.</p>
<p>We have to risk our wealth, at a venture!</p>
<p>A merchant, by my faith, can’t endure</p>
<p>For long, trust me, in his prosperity.</p>
<p>Sometimes his wealth is drowned in the sea,</p>
<p>And sometimes it comes home safe to land.’</p>
<p>‘Peace!’ quoth my lord,’ Next time, you understand,</p>
<p>I’ll try to bring our craft to perfection,</p>
<p>And if I do not, sires, condemn my actions!</p>
<p>There was a fault, though what fault I know not.’</p>
<p>Another claimed the fire was over hot –</p>
<p>But, be it hot or cold, I dare say this,</p>
<p>Our attempt would still have gone amiss.</p>
<p>We fail to profit from all that we gave,</p>
<p>And in our madness evermore we rave.</p>
<p>And when we are together, everyone</p>
<p>Seems as wise as was King Solomon;</p>
<p>But everything that glitters is not gold</p>
<p>Nor everything that shines, I am told,</p>
<p>Nor is every apple that meets the eye</p>
<p>Good to eat, whatever the hue and cry.</p>
<p>Right so, behold, it fares amongst us:</p>
<p>He that seems the wisest man, by Jesus,</p>
<p>Is the biggest fool, when put to proof,</p>
<p>And who seems honest is a thief, in truth.</p>
<p>This you shall know, ere from you I wend,</p>
<p>By the time my tale has reached an end.</p>

<p>There is a canon now of religion</p>
<p>Amongst us, who could infect a town,</p>
<p>Though it were as great as Nineveh,</p>
<p>With Rome, Troy, and Alexandria.</p>
<p>His tricks and infinite deceitfulness</p>
<p>Are more than a man could write, I guess,</p>
<p>Though he might live for a thousand years.</p>
<p>In all this world of falsehood, it appears,</p>
<p>He has no equal, with jargon he’ll blind</p>
<p>All men, and speak, too, in so sly a kind,</p>
<p>When he communes with any day or night,</p>
<p>That he will make the man a fool outright,</p>
<p>Unless he is a fiend, as he himself is.</p>
<p>For many a man has he beguiled ere this,</p>
<p>And will, if he may live a little while.</p>
<p>And yet men ride, and go many a mile</p>
<p>To seek him out, and make his acquaintance,</p>
<p>Not knowing of his false governance.</p>
<p>And if you will grant me audience,</p>
<p>I will tell of it here, in your presence.</p>
<p>But worshipful canons, all religious,</p>
<p>Don’t think that I am slandering your house,</p>
<p>Although my tale may of a canon be.</p>
<p>In every order, some are rogues, we see!</p>
<p>And God forbid that a whole company</p>
<p>Should all do penance for one man’s folly.</p>
<p>To slander you is hardly my intent,</p>
<p>But to correct what is wrong, is meant.</p>
<p>This tale is not told for you alone, now,</p>
<p>But more for others. You well know how</p>
<p>That among Christ’s Apostles twelve</p>
<p>There was no traitor but Judas himself;</p>
<p>Then why would all the rest share the blame</p>
<p>Who were guiltless? Of you I say the same –</p>
<p>Save only this, if you will hark to me:</p>
<p>If any Judas in your convent be</p>
<p>Remove him swiftly, be it on your head</p>
<p>If shame or loss should ever cause you dread.</p>
<p>And be not displeased with me, I pray,</p>
<p>But in this instance hark to what I say.</p>
<p>In London lived a chantry priest I hear,</p>
<p>Who therein had dwelt for many a year,</p>
<p>Who was so agreeable and so able,</p>
<p>The housewife where he sat at table,</p>
<p>Would allow him not a coin to pay</p>
<p>For board or clothing, whatever his display;</p>
<p>And he had spending-silver too, and how.</p>
<p>No matter; I will proceed for now,</p>
<p>And tell forth all my tale of the canon</p>
<p>Who brought this priest to great confusion.</p>
<p>The false canon went along one day</p>
<p>To the priest’s chamber where he lay,</p>
<p>Beseeching him to lend him a certain</p>
<p>Sum of gold, which he’d repay again.</p>
<p>‘Lend me a mark,’ quoth he, ‘but days three,</p>
<p>And on the day appointed I’ll pay thee.</p>
<p>And if so be that you find me false,</p>
<p>The next day hang me from the walls!’</p>
<p>The priest took out a mark, at once,</p>
<p>And the canon thanked him anon,</p>
<p>And took his leave, and went forth on his way,</p>
<p>And on the third day came to repay,</p>
<p>And gave his gold to the priest again,</p>
<p>Of which the priest was glad, it’s plain.</p>
<p>‘Certainly,’ quoth he, ‘it’s fine by me</p>
<p>To lend a man a noble, or two, or three,</p>
<p>Or anything that is in my possession,</p>
<p>When he’s of such honest disposition</p>
<p>That he’ll in no wise fail of his day.</p>
<p>To such a man I never can say nay.’</p>
<p>‘What,’ quoth the canon, ‘I be untrue?</p>
<p>Nay, that would indeed be something new!</p>
<p>My honour is a thing I’ll ever keep</p>
<p>Until the final day on which I creep</p>
<p>Into my grave, all else God forbid!</p>
<p>Believe in this as surely as the Creed!</p>
<p>God be thanked, in good time be it said,</p>
<p>There was never a man not repaid</p>
<p>By me with the gold or silver he had lent,</p>
<p>Nor never a falsehood in my intent.</p>
<p>And sire,’ quoth he, ‘now all privately,</p>
<p>Since you have show such courtesy to me,</p>
<p>And dealt with me with such nobleness,</p>
<p>To repay you somewhat for your goodness</p>
<p>I’ll tell you something: if you wish to hear,</p>
<p>I’ll teach you plainly all the manner</p>
<p>In which I can work true alchemy.</p>
<p>Take good heed; with your own eye you’ll see</p>
<p>That I will work a miracle ere I go.’</p>
<p>‘Yea?’ quoth the priest, ‘Sire, and will you so?</p>
<p>Marry! I pray you do so, heartily.’</p>
<p>‘At your command, sire, I shall do, truly,’</p>
<p>Quoth the canon, ‘all else God forbid!’</p>
<p>Lo, how this thief could his service bid!</p>
<p>True indeed it is that proffered service</p>
<p>Stinks: call the old and wise as witness;</p>
<p>And that full soon you will surely see</p>
<p>In this canon, root of all treachery,</p>
<p>Who evermore delights and finds gladness –</p>
<p>Such fiendish tricks his thoughts express –</p>
<p>When on Christ’s people mischief he does bring.</p>
<p>God keep us from his false dissembling!</p>
<p>The priest knew nothing of with whom he dealt,</p>
<p>And of the coming harm he nothing felt.</p>
<p>O foolish priest, O foolish innocent,</p>
<p>By covetousness, anon, to be rent!</p>
<p>O devoid of grace: blind your conceit!</p>
<p>Utterly unaware of the deceit</p>
<p>This cunning fox has crafted for thee.</p>
<p>From his wily tricks you may not flee;</p>
<p>And therefore to reach my conclusion</p>
<p>Which concerns your utter confusion,</p>
<p>Unhappy man, I will move on swiftly</p>
<p>To tell of your stupidity and folly,</p>
<p>And the falseness of that other wretch,</p>
<p>As far as my ability may stretch.</p>
<p>This canon was my lord, you think I mean?</p>
<p>Sir Host, in faith, and by the Heavens’ Queen,</p>
<p>It was another canon, and not he,</p>
<p>A hundred-fold deeper in subtlety.</p>
<p>He has betrayed folks many a time;</p>
<p>Of his falseness it troubles me to rhyme.</p>
<p>Whenever I speak about his falsehood,</p>
<p>For shame of him my cheeks fill with blood</p>
<p>– At any rate, they begin to glow,</p>
<p>For redness I have none, as I do know,</p>
<p>In my visage, for the fumes all diverse</p>
<p>Of metals, which you heard me rehearse,</p>
<p>Consumed and wasted have my redness.</p>
<p>Take heed of this canon’s wickedness!</p>
<p>‘Sire,’ quoth he to the priest, ‘Send your man</p>
<p>For quicksilver, so we have some on hand;</p>
<p>And let him bring us two ounces or three;</p>
<p>And when he returns, then you shall see</p>
<p>A wondrous thing you never saw ere this.’</p>
<p>‘Sire,’ quoth the priest, ‘as you command, it is.’</p>
<p>He bade his servant fetch him this thing,</p>
<p>And he was all ready at his bidding,</p>
<p>And so went forth, and came anon again</p>
<p>With this quicksilver, briefly to explain,</p>
<p>And handed three ounces to the canon;</p>
<p>And he laid them fair and well adown,</p>
<p>And bade the servant coals for to bring,</p>
<p>That he might at once begin its working.</p>
<p>The servant swiftly brought the coal,</p>
<p>And the canon then took a crucible</p>
<p>From his bosom, and showed it to the priest.</p>
<p>‘This instrument,’ quoth he, ‘which you see,</p>
<p>Take it in hand yourself, and place therein</p>
<p>Of this quicksilver an ounce, and so begin,</p>
<p>In Christ’s name, to be a philosopher.</p>
<p>There are few indeed to whom I’d offer</p>
<p>To show them this much of all my science,</p>
<p>For you shall see here, by experience,</p>
<p>This quicksilver I’ll harden, by and by,</p>
<p>Right in your sight anon, without a lie,</p>
<p>And make it as good silver, and as fine,</p>
<p>As there is any in your purse, or mine,</p>
<p>Or elsewhere, and make it malleable –</p>
<p>Else hold me as false, and unable</p>
<p>Ever amongst true folks to appear!</p>
<p>I have a powder here, that cost me dear,</p>
<p>Which makes all good, it’s the root of all</p>
<p>My power, of which I’ll show you more.</p>
<p>Send your man away, he can stand without,</p>
<p>And shut the door while we are about</p>
<p>Our private tasks, that no man may us see,</p>
<p>While we work at all this alchemy.’</p>
<p>All that he asked was fulfilled in deed:</p>
<p>The servant was sent away with speed,</p>
<p>And his master shut the door anon,</p>
<p>And to their labour swiftly are they gone.</p>
<p>The priest, at this wretched canon’s bidding,</p>
<p>Upon the fire anon set this thing,</p>
<p>And blew the fire, and busied him full fast.</p>
<p>And the canon into the crucible cast</p>
<p>A powder – I know not what it was</p>
<p>Chalk perhaps, perhaps it was of glass,</p>
<p>Or something else not worth a fly,</p>
<p>To blind this priest with – and bade him ply</p>
<p>The tongs, and lay the coal all above</p>
<p>The crucible: ‘As a token I thee love,’</p>
<p>Quoth this canon, ‘with your own hands two</p>
<p>Shall you work the thing which here we do.’</p>
<p>‘Graunt merci,’ quoth the priest, and was full glad,</p>
<p>And laid the coals out as the canon bade.</p>
<p>And while he was busy, the fiendish wretch,</p>
<p>This false canon – the foul fiend him fetch! –</p>
<p>Out of his bosom took a beech-wood coal,</p>
<p>In which all subtly he had bored a hole,</p>
<p>And put therein silver filings from the scale,</p>
<p>An ounce, and sealed it was, without fail,</p>
<p>That hole with wax, to keep the silver in.</p>
<p>And understand that this false piece of sin</p>
<p>Was not made there, but it was made before;</p>
<p>And other things that I shall tell of more</p>
<p>Hereafter, that he with him had brought.</p>
<p>Ere he came, to beguile the priest he thought;</p>
<p>And so he did, ere that they had parted.</p>
<p>He couldn’t wait to fleece him, once he’d started.</p>
<p>It angers me when of him I speak;</p>
<p>On his falsehood vengeance would I wreak,</p>
<p>If I knew how, but he is here and there;</p>
<p>He’s so changeable, he abides nowhere.</p>
<p>But take heed now, sires, for God’s love:</p>
<p>He took the coal, of which I spoke above,</p>
<p>And in his hand he held it covertly,</p>
<p>And while the priest was working busily</p>
<p>With the other coals, as I said ere this,</p>
<p>The canon spoke: ‘Friend, you’ve gone amiss.</p>
<p>This is not laid out as it ought to be.</p>
<p>But I’ll soon amend it now,’ quoth he.</p>
<p>Let me fiddle with all this for a while,</p>
<p>For I take pity on you, by Saint Giles!</p>
<p>You are full hot – I see how you do sweat.</p>
<p>Here, take a cloth, and wipe away the wet.’</p>
<p>And while the priest stood and wiped his face,</p>
<p>The canon took his coal – may he lack grace! –</p>
<p>And laid it above, on the middle ward</p>
<p>Of the crucible, and blew well afterward,</p>
<p>Till the coals burnt vigorously, and then:</p>
<p>‘Give us a drink,’ quoth the canon ‘when,</p>
<p>In a trice all will be well, I undertake.</p>
<p>Sit us down, and let us merry make.’</p>
<p>And when the canon’s beechen coal</p>
<p>Was burnt, all the metal from the hole</p>
<p>Into the crucible flowed down anon</p>
<p>– For so it had to do, as stands to reason,</p>
<p>Since laid so levelly above it was.</p>
<p>But the priest knew naught of it, alas!</p>
<p>He thought all the coals equally good,</p>
<p>For of the trick he nothing understood.</p>
<p>And when the alchemist saw it was time,</p>
<p>‘Rise up,’ quoth he, ‘sir priest and stand by me,</p>
<p>And since an ingot mould I know you’ve none,</p>
<p>Go walk forth, and bring me some chalk-stone,</p>
<p>For I will mould it into the same shape</p>
<p>That a silver ingot has, its form I’ll ape.</p>
<p>And bring with you, too, a bowl or pan</p>
<p>Full of water and you will see, good man,</p>
<p>How our affair shall prosper and conceive.</p>
<p>But wait: so that you may not misbelieve</p>
<p>Nor have suspicions of me in your absence,</p>
<p>I will not stay here out of your presence,</p>
<p>But go with you, and come with you again.’</p>
<p>The chamber door, shortly, to explain,</p>
<p>They opened and shut, and went their way,</p>
<p>And carried the key with them, I may say,</p>
<p>And came back again without delay.</p>
<p>Why tarry, in telling this, the livelong day?</p>
<p>He took the chalk, and carved it in the wise</p>
<p>Of a silver ingot mould, that’s no surprise.</p>
<p>I say, he took from out of his own sleeve</p>
<p>A silver rod – curse those who do deceive! –</p>
<p>Which was exactly a full ounce in weight.</p>
<p>And take heed now of the trick he played:</p>
<p>He carved his ingot mould in length and breadth</p>
<p>To fit this rod, cunningly, as I said,</p>
<p>So slyly that the priest naught espied,</p>
<p>And in his sleeve again he did it hide,</p>
<p>And from the fire he took up his matter,</p>
<p>And poured it in the mould, with merry cheer,</p>
<p>Then in the water he the mould did cast</p>
<p>As he wished; and the priest called at the last,</p>
<p>‘Look what is there – put in your hand and grope!</p>
<p>You will find silver there, I dare to hope.’</p>
<p>What else, by the Devil and Hell, could it be?</p>
<p>Silver shavings formed it, utterly!</p>
<p>The priest put in his hand, and plain as plain</p>
<p>Found the silver rod: joy through every vein</p>
<p>Of the priest coursed, on seeing it was so.</p>
<p>‘God’s blessing, and his mother’s also,</p>
<p>And all his saints, on you, sir canon!’</p>
<p>Said the priest, ‘and on me derision,</p>
<p>If – should you agree that you’ll teach me</p>
<p>This noble craft and all its subtlety –</p>
<p>I am not yours, in all that ever I may.’</p>
<p>Quoth the canon: ‘Yet will I make assay</p>
<p>A second time, so that you may take heed</p>
<p>And become expert, and when you need</p>
<p>To do so, another day, in my absence,</p>
<p>Work this discipline and skilful science.</p>
<p>Let us take up another ounce,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Of quicksilver, at once, and rapidly</p>
<p>Do with it as you have done ere this</p>
<p>With the other, which turned to silver is.’</p>
<p>The priest busies himself quick as he can</p>
<p>To do just as the canon, that wicked man,</p>
<p>Has commanded him, and fast blows the fire</p>
<p>To come at all the fruits of his desire.</p>
<p>And the canon too, in the meanwhile,</p>
<p>Is all ready the priest to twice beguile;</p>
<p>And in pretence in his hand does bear</p>
<p>A hollow stick – take note and be aware! –</p>
<p>In the end of which an ounce, and no more</p>
<p>Of silver metal was placed, as before</p>
<p>In the coal, and sealed with wax as well,</p>
<p>To keep the bits of metal where they must dwell.</p>
<p>And while the priest arranged the business,</p>
<p>The canon with his stick began to address</p>
<p>The crucible and all his powder he cast in,</p>
<p>As he did before – the devil out of his skin</p>
<p>Flay him, I pray to God, for his deceit!</p>
<p>For he was ever false in thought and deed –</p>
<p>And with his stick, above the crucible,</p>
<p>That was all charged with that false metal,</p>
<p>He stirred the coals till to melt began</p>
<p>The wax within the fire, as every man,</p>
<p>Knows well it should, unless he is a fool,</p>
<p>And all that was in the stick poured out too</p>
<p>And into the crucible it swiftly fell.</p>
<p>Now, good sires, what do you think befell?</p>
<p>When the priest was thus beguiled again,</p>
<p>Supposing it naught but true, truth to say,</p>
<p>He was so glad I can scarce express</p>
<p>The nature of his mirth and his gladness;</p>
<p>As for the canon he offered him the moon,</p>
<p>His body and soul. Quoth the canon soon,</p>
<p>‘Though poor I be, skilful you shall me find,</p>
<p>I warn you; and there is yet more behind.</p>
<p>Is there any copper about?’ said he.</p>
<p>‘Yes, sire,’ quoth the priest, ‘I think there be.’</p>
<p>– ‘If not, go buy some now for us, quickly!</p>
<p>Good sire, be on your way, and haste thee.’</p>
<p>The priest went off, and with the copper came,</p>
<p>And the canon took in his hands the same,</p>
<p>And of the copper weighed out just an ounce.</p>
<p>All too powerless is my tongue to pronounce,</p>
<p>As minister to my thought, the wickedness</p>
<p>Of this canon, root of all sinfulness!</p>
<p>He seemed a friend to those who knew him not,</p>
<p>But he was a fiend, in his deeds and thought.</p>
<p>It wearies me to tell of all his falseness,</p>
<p>Yet nevertheless, I will it all express,</p>
<p>So that men may be made aware, thereby,</p>
<p>And for no other reason, the truth say I.</p>
<p>The ounce of copper in the crucible</p>
<p>He placed, and on the fire set the metal,</p>
<p>Cast in the powder, made the priest to blow,</p>
<p>And in his working made him stoop down low,</p>
<p>As he did before – the whole thing was a jape;</p>
<p>As he had wished, he made the priest his ape!</p>
<p>And afterwards, in the mould the metal cast,</p>
<p>And in the pan placed it at the last</p>
<p>Of water, and into it put his hand,</p>
<p>And in his sleeve (just as beforehand</p>
<p>You heard me tell) he had a silver rod.</p>
<p>He slyly took it out, this cursed of God,</p>
<p>The priest ignorant still of his false craft,</p>
<p>And in the bottom of the pan (you laughed!)</p>
<p>Placed it, tumbling the water to and fro,</p>
<p>And wondrous secretly took up also</p>
<p>The copper rod, invisibly to the priest,</p>
<p>And hid it, and by the arm him seized,</p>
<p>And spoke to him, and carried on the game:</p>
<p>‘Stoop down now – by God, or you’re to blame! –</p>
<p>Help me now, as I did you before. Where</p>
<p>Is your hand? Dip in, and see what’s there.’</p>
<p>The priest took up the silver rod anon;</p>
<p>And then said the canon: ‘Let us now be gone,</p>
<p>With these three rods, that we have wrought,</p>
<p>To a goldsmith, and see if they be aught.</p>
<p>For, by my faith I’d swear, by my hood,</p>
<p>That they are pure silver, fine and good,</p>
<p>And that swiftly proven shall it be.’</p>
<p>Off to the goldsmith with these rods three</p>
<p>They went, and put the rods to the assay</p>
<p>With fire and hammer; and none could say</p>
<p>They were not what they ought to be.</p>
<p>The foolish priest, who was gladder than he?</p>
<p>There was never bird gladder to see the day,</p>
<p>No nightingale in the merry month of May</p>
<p>Was ever more eager than him to sing,</p>
<p>No lady more vigorous in carolling,</p>
<p>Or speaking of love and womanhood,</p>
<p>No knight in arms to show as brave and good,</p>
<p>To gain the favour of his lady dear,</p>
<p>Than was this priest an expert to appear!</p>
<p>And to the canon thus he loudly cried:</p>
<p>‘For love of God, who for us all has died,</p>
<p>And as I may deserve your favour, how</p>
<p>Much does this secret cost? Tell me now!’</p>
<p>‘By our lady,’ quoth the canon, ‘it comes dear,</p>
<p>I warn you; for save I, and one, my peer,</p>
<p>In England no other man can silver make.’</p>
<p>‘No matter,’ quoth he, ‘now, sire, for God’s sake,</p>
<p>What must I pay? Tell me that, I pray.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ quoth he, ‘it is full dear, I say.</p>
<p>Sire, in a word, if such is what you crave,</p>
<p>You must pay forty pounds, so God me save!</p>
<p>And were it not for the friendship, as it is,</p>
<p>You’ve showed to me, it would be more than this.’</p>
<p>The priest the sum of forty pounds anon,</p>
<p>In nobles, fetched, and took them every one</p>
<p>To the canon for his formula, complete.</p>
<p>All his working was but fraud and deceit.</p>
<p>‘Sir priest,’ he said, ‘I cannot make the most</p>
<p>Of my craft, its secrets must be kept close;</p>
<p>So, as you love me, keep them secretly,</p>
<p>For, if men knew of all my subtlety,</p>
<p>By God, they’d be so possessed by envy</p>
<p>Of me, because of all my alchemy,</p>
<p>I’d be stone dead; that would be their way.’</p>
<p>‘God forbid!’ quoth the priest, ‘What’s this you say?</p>
<p>I’d rather spend all the wealth I had,</p>
<p>Or hope to have, else may I be mad,</p>
<p>Than to see you suffer such misdeed.’</p>
<p>‘Of your goodwill, you show proof indeed!’</p>
<p>Quoth the canon, ‘Now farewell, grant merci!’</p>
<p>He went his way, and never the priest did see</p>
<p>Him from that day to this; and when the priest</p>
<p>Made assay, the next time that he wished,</p>
<p>Of the formula, farewell! – It was deceit!</p>
<p>Lo thus befuddled, and beguiled was he!</p>
<p>So does the canon make preparation</p>
<p>To bring folk to their own destruction.</p>
<p>Consider, sires, how in all walks of life,</p>
<p>Between men and gold there is ever strife,</p>
<p>So much so that there is scarcely any.</p>
<p>This alchemy now has so blinded many</p>
<p>That, in good faith, I swear that it must be</p>
<p>The greatest cause of all this scarcity.</p>
<p>Philosophers speak so mistily</p>
<p>Of this craft, that men can barely see,</p>
<p>Not with the wit that men have nowadays.</p>
<p>They may go on chattering like jays,</p>
<p>And on its jargon wager joy and pain,</p>
<p>But to its end they never will attain.</p>
<p>A man easily learn, if he owns aught,</p>
<p>To ‘multiply’, and bring his wealth to naught.</p>
<p>Lo, such a profit there is in this sweet game:</p>
<p>A man’s mirth it will turn to woe and shame,</p>
<p>Empty out their large and heavy purses,</p>
<p>And end in folk purchasing fresh curses</p>
<p>From those that to it their wealth have turned.</p>
<p>O fie, for shame! – They that have been burned,</p>
<p>Can they not learn, alas, to shun the heat?</p>
<p>You that try it, I’d advise you flee it,</p>
<p>Or lose all; better than never is late.</p>
<p>For wealth, ‘never’ is far too long to wait;</p>
<p>Though you search always, you’ll never find.</p>
<p>You are as bold as Bayard is, the blind</p>
<p>And blundering horse, perils all unknown.</p>
<p>He is as like to run against a stone</p>
<p>As to wander along the broad highway.</p>
<p>So fare you all who ‘multiply’ I say.</p>
<p>If your eyes cannot see aright,</p>
<p>Be careful your mind lacks not its sight;</p>
<p>For though you gaze ever so wide, or stare,</p>
<p>You’ll win nothing at all by dabbling there,</p>
<p>But merely waste all you may seize in turn.</p>
<p>Dampen the fire lest it swiftly burn;</p>
<p>Meddle no more with all that art, I mean,</p>
<p>For if you do, your coffers will be clean.</p>
<p>And listen to me again, here’s the chatter:</p>
<p>What true alchemists made of this matter.</p>
<p>Give Arnold of Villanova your attention –</p>
<p>In his Rosary the process he does mention –</p>
<p>He speaks thus, without shadow of a lie:</p>
<p>‘No man may harden mercury, say I,</p>
<p>Without his brother sulphur inflowing.’</p>
<p>Yet the man who first said this thing</p>
<p>Was the father of the alchemists, Hermes;</p>
<p>He says that the dragon, if you please,</p>
<p>Does not die unless he in turn is slain</p>
<p>With his brother, and, I should explain,</p>
<p>By the dragon, mercury, and no other</p>
<p>He understood, and brimstone by his brother,</p>
<p>That out of Sol and Luna men do draw.</p>
<p>‘And therefore,’ said he – listen to my lore –</p>
<p>‘Let no man busy himself those heights to reach,</p>
<p>Unless the intention and the speech</p>
<p>Of the alchemists he does understand.</p>
<p>And if he does not, he’s a foolish man;</p>
<p>For this science and this skill,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Is the most secret of secrets, trust in me.’</p>
<p>Also there was a disciple of Plato</p>
<p>Who once spoke to his master – I know,</p>
<p>For the book Senior Zadith bears witness –</p>
<p>Making demand that the truth he express:</p>
<p>‘Tell me the name of the secret stone.’</p>
<p>And Plato answered him right anon:</p>
<p>‘Take the stone that men Titanos name – ’</p>
<p>‘What is that?’ quoth he; ‘Magnesia is the same,’</p>
<p>Said Plato. ‘Yea, sire, and is it thus?</p>
<p>You explain ignotum per ignocius!</p>
<p>What is Magnesia then, good sire, I pray?’</p>
<p>‘It is a liquid that is made, I say,</p>
<p>Out of four elements,’ then quoth Plato.</p>
<p>‘Tell me the root, good sire,’ quoth he also,</p>
<p>‘Of that liquid, if so be your will.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ quoth Plato, ‘It is a secret, still!</p>
<p>The philosophers are sworn every one</p>
<p>To reveal the essence of this to none,</p>
<p>Nor write it in a book in any manner,</p>
<p>For to God it is so precious and dear</p>
<p>That he wishes not its discovery,</p>
<p>Save where it is pleasing to his deity</p>
<p>To enlighten men, and thus to defend</p>
<p>The truth from others; lo, this is the end!’</p>
<p>So I conclude thus, since the God of Heaven</p>
<p>Won’t allow philosophers, with reason,</p>
<p>To say how men might come at this stone,</p>
<p>I advise you for the best, let it alone!</p>
<p>For whoever makes God his adversary,</p>
<p>And tries to work a thing that’s contrary</p>
<p>To His will, for sure, shall never thrive,</p>
<p>Though he ‘multiply’ as long as he’s alive.</p>
<p>And that’s the point; for ended is my tale.</p>
<p>God send every true man grace without fail!</p>


<p>Do you all know where stands a little town</p>
<p>Which everybody calls Bob-Up-and-Down,</p>
<p>Under the Blean, down Canterbury way?</p>
<p>There our Host began to jest and play,</p>
<p>And said: ‘Sires, we’re stuck! Dun’s in the mire!</p>
<p>Is there no man, for prayer or for hire,</p>
<p>Will wake our friend sleeping there behind?</p>
<p>A thief as now might easily rob him blind.</p>
<p>Look at him napping! See how, God’s bones,</p>
<p>He’ll tumble from his horse onto the stones!</p>
<p>Is that the London Cook, cursed mischance?</p>
<p>Make him come forth, and do his penance,</p>
<p>For he shall tell a tale too, by my faith,</p>
<p>Although it’s not worth a barrow of hay.</p>
<p>Awake, thou Cook!’ quoth he, ‘God give you sorrow!</p>
<p>What ails you to sleep this fine morrow?</p>
<p>Did fleas bite you all night? Or are you drunk?</p>
<p>Or had you a harlot all night in your bunk,</p>
<p>So you’ve not the strength to lift your head?’</p>
<p>The Cook, who was full pale and nothing red,</p>
<p>Said to our Host: ‘So God my soul may bless,</p>
<p>There fell upon me such a heaviness –</p>
<p>I know not why – I’d rather have my sleep</p>
<p>Than the best barrel of wine in Westcheap.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ quoth the Manciple, ‘it it may ease</p>
<p>Your pain, Sir Cook, and no one else displease</p>
<p>That rides among us in this company,</p>
<p>And if our Host agrees, of his courtesy,</p>
<p>I will for now excuse you of your tale.</p>
<p>For in good faith your visage is full pale.</p>
<p>Your eyes are dull as well now, methinks,</p>
<p>And I find your breath full sour it stinks;</p>
<p>It’s obvious that you are indisposed.</p>
<p>By me, for certain, you’d not be proposed!</p>
<p>See how he yawns now, this drunken knight,</p>
<p>As though he would swallow us all aright.</p>
<p>Close your mouth man, by your father’s kin!</p>
<p>The devil from Hell has set his foot therein!</p>
<p>Your cursed breath will soon infect us all.</p>
<p>Fie, stinking swine, to foulness you’ll fall!</p>
<p>Ah, take heed, sires, of this gallant man!</p>
<p>Now, sweet sire, will you joust at the fan?</p>
<p>It looks as if you’re in perfect shape!</p>
<p>I’d say you’re as drunken as an ape,</p>
<p>That’s when men suck wine out with a straw.’</p>
<p>At this speech the Cook grew wrath and raw,</p>
<p>At the Manciple he shook his head full fast</p>
<p>For lack of speech, and off the horse him cast,</p>
<p>Where he lay a-sprawling, till someone took</p>
<p>Him up: this was a fair horseman of a cook!</p>
<p>Alas, he couldn’t hold on by his ladle!</p>
<p>And, ere he was once more in the saddle,</p>
<p>There was much shoving, both to and fro,</p>
<p>To get him up, a deal of care and woe,</p>
<p>So helpless was this sorry pallid ghost.</p>
<p>And to the Manciple then spoke our Host:</p>
<p>‘Because drink has the domination</p>
<p>Of this poor man, by my salvation,</p>
<p>I think but poorly he’d tell his tale.</p>
<p>Whether it’s wine or old or fresh-brewed ale</p>
<p>That he’s drunk, he’s speaking through his nose,</p>
<p>And wheezing hard, and like to have a cold.</p>
<p>He’s more than enough to do right now</p>
<p>To keep him and his horse from the slough;</p>
<p>And if he falls from his horse a time or two,</p>
<p>Then we shall all have enough to do</p>
<p>In lifting of his heavy drunken carcase.</p>
<p>Tell on your tale; he’s nothing to the purpose.</p>
<p>– Yet, Manciple, it’s hardly my advice</p>
<p>To openly reprove him for his vice.</p>
<p>Another day, he will, peradventure,</p>
<p>Reclaim you, and call you to the lure.</p>
<p>I mean, he’ll chatter about little things,</p>
<p>Such as small errors in your reckonings,</p>
<p>All not quite honest, if it came to proof.’</p>
<p>‘What,’ quoth the Manciple, ‘is that the truth!</p>
<p>So might he easily catch me in a snare.</p>
<p>Well now, I’d rather pay him for the mare</p>
<p>He rides on, than have him with me strive.</p>
<p>I’ll not anger him so, as I would thrive!</p>
<p>Whatever I spoke, I said but jesting word.</p>
<p>And know you now I have here in a gourd</p>
<p>A draught of wine, yea, of a ripened grape,</p>
<p>And right anon you’ll see a merry jape.</p>
<p>The Cook must drink thereof, indeed, I say;</p>
<p>On pain of death, he shall not say me nay.’</p>
<p>And certainly, to tell this as it was,</p>
<p>The Cook drank from it fast enough – alas!</p>
<p>What need, since he’d been drunk all the morn?</p>
<p>And when he had tooted on this merry horn,</p>
<p>To the Manciple he gave the gourd again;</p>
<p>And with that drink the Cook was free of pain,</p>
<p>And thanked him, best as he could, and bowed.</p>
<p>Then our Host began to laugh wondrous loud,</p>
<p>And said: ‘I see now, that it’s necessary,</p>
<p>When we go abroad, good drink to carry,</p>
<p>For it will turn all rancour and distress</p>
<p>To peace and love, and many a wrong redress.</p>
<p>O Bacchus, now thus blessed be your name,</p>
<p>That can so make of earnestness a game!</p>
<p>Worship and thanks be to your deity!</p>
<p>Of all that now you’ll get no more of me;</p>
<p>Tell on your tale, sir Manciple, I pray.’</p>
<p>‘Well, sire,’ quoth he, ‘now hark to what I say.’</p>


<p>When Phoebus had on earth his habitation,</p>
<p>As the ancient books are pleased to mention,</p>
<p>He was the most gallant of bachelors</p>
<p>In all this world, and the best of archers.</p>
<p>He slew Python, the serpent, as he lay</p>
<p>Sleeping on the ground one sunny day.</p>
<p>And many another noble worthy deed</p>
<p>He wrought with his great bow, as men may read.</p>
<p>And every instrument of minstrelsy,</p>
<p>He could play, and sing, that a melody</p>
<p>It was merely to hear his clear voice sound.</p>
<p>In truth, the King of Thebes, Amphion,</p>
<p>Who with his singing walled a city,</p>
<p>Could never sing half so well as he.</p>
<p>And also he was the handsomest man</p>
<p>That is, or was, since all the world began.</p>
<p>What need his noble features to describe?</p>
<p>– For in this world was none so fair alive,</p>
<p>He was filled full, as well, with nobleness,</p>
<p>With honour, and perfect courteousness.</p>
<p>This Phoebus, the flower of chivalry</p>
<p>And noted as well for magnanimity,</p>
<p>To sport himself – and mark his victory</p>
<p>Over Python, so runs the old story –</p>
<p>Was wont to carry in his hand a bow.</p>
<p>Now Phoebus in his house he had a crow,</p>
<p>That in a cage he nurtured many a day,</p>
<p>And taught to speak, as men will teach a jay.</p>
<p>White was this crow as is a snow-white swan,</p>
<p>And counterfeited the speech of every man</p>
<p>Whenever he set out to tell a tale.</p>
<p>And too, in all this world, no nightingale</p>
<p>Could in a hundred thousandth part excel</p>
<p>In singing so wondrous sweet and well. </p>
<p>Now in his house this Phoebus had a wife,</p>
<p>Whom he loved more than his very life,</p>
<p>And night and day he showed his diligence</p>
<p>In pleasing her, and doing her reverence;</p>
<p>Except for the fact that, truth to say,</p>
<p>He was jealous, and in a gilded cage</p>
<p>Would have kept her, and live undeceived.</p>
<p>And so is every man to some degree;</p>
<p>But all in vain, for it avails us naught.</p>
<p>A good wife who’s chaste in deed and thought,</p>
<p>Should not be spied upon, that’s for certain;</p>
<p>And truly it is labour all in vain</p>
<p>To keep watch on a bad one, can’t succeed.</p>
<p>This I hold as foolishness indeed,</p>
<p>To waste labour keeping watch on wives.</p>
<p>– Thus the ancients wrote throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Now to my purpose, as I first began:</p>
<p>This noble Phoebus does the best he can</p>
<p>To please her, thinking to dance attendance,</p>
<p>And that with his courtesy and governance,</p>
<p>No man would eclipse him from her grace.</p>
<p>But, God knows, no man can embrace</p>
<p>With restraints anything that nature</p>
<p>Has naturally implanted in a creature.</p>
<p>Take a bird: imprison him in a cage,</p>
<p>And all your care and your intent engage</p>
<p>On feeding him tenderly with meat and drink,</p>
<p>And every dainty of which you can think,</p>
<p>And keep him there as tidily as you may,</p>
<p>Although his gilded cage be never so gay,</p>
<p>Yet would the bird twenty thousand fold</p>
<p>Prefer his forest, however harsh and cold,</p>
<p>A diet of worms, and other nastiness.</p>
<p>Forever this bird will be about the business</p>
<p>Of escaping from his cage, if he may;</p>
<p>His liberty the bird desires, I say.</p>
<p>Or take a cat, and nurture it well on milk</p>
<p>And tender flesh, and make his bed of silk,</p>
<p>Let him but see a mouse by the wall –</p>
<p>Anon he abandons milk and flesh and all,</p>
<p>And every dainty thing that’s in the house,</p>
<p>Such is his appetite to eat a mouse!</p>
<p>Lo, here has desire its domination,</p>
<p>And appetite banishes discretion.</p>
<p>She-wolves too are of the baser kind:</p>
<p>The coarsest wolf that she may find,</p>
<p>Or least in reputation, will she take,</p>
<p>When the time comes to find a mate.</p>
<p>All these examples are aimed at men</p>
<p>Who prove untrue, in no way at women.</p>
<p>For men have ever a lecherous appetite</p>
<p>On lower things to perform their delight</p>
<p>Than on their wives, be they ever so fair,</p>
<p>Or be they ever so true, and debonair.</p>
<p>Flesh is so fond of novelty – sad mischance! –</p>
<p>Newfangledness finds nothing in the glance</p>
<p>That’s in accord with virtue, for any while.</p>
<p>This Phoebus, who was innocent of guile,</p>
<p>Was deceived, despite that he was comely,</p>
<p>For under him another man had she,</p>
<p>He a man of little reputation,</p>
<p>Not worth Phoebus in comparison.</p>
<p>More is the harm, it happens often so,</p>
<p>From which there comes much harm and woe.</p>
<p>So it befell, when Phoebus was absent,</p>
<p>His wife anon for her cocksman sent.</p>
<p>Her cocksman? Indeed, a knavish speech!</p>
<p>Forgive me the term, I do beseech</p>
<p>Plato, the wise, says this, as you may read:</p>
<p>The word should ever accord with the deed.</p>
<p>If a man would speak rightly of a thing,</p>
<p>The word must be cousin to the doing.</p>
<p>I’m a blunt man, and right thus say I:</p>
<p>There is no difference, to my eye,</p>
<p>Between a wife who is of high degree,</p>
<p>If with her body she dishonest be,</p>
<p>And a poor wench, lower than all this –</p>
<p>If it so be they both do go amiss –</p>
<p>Except that the gentlewoman above,</p>
<p>Will be called his lady, as in love,</p>
<p>But the other who’s a poor woman,</p>
<p>Shall be called his wench or his lemman.</p>
<p>Yet God knows, my own dear brother,</p>
<p>Men lay the one as low as lies the other.</p>
<p>Just as between a usurping tyrant</p>
<p>And an outlaw or a thief arrant,</p>
<p>The same appertains; there’s no difference.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great heard just this sentence:</p>
<p>That because a tyrant has great might,</p>
<p>By force of armies to slay outright,</p>
<p>And burn house and home, and scorch the plain,</p>
<p>Lo he’s a mighty general, men explain;</p>
<p>But the outlaw with a tiny company,</p>
<p>Who may not do as great harm as he,</p>
<p>Nor bring a country to such great mischief,</p>
<p>Men label him an outlaw or a thief.</p>
<p>But as I am unlearned, not textual,</p>
<p>Never a word of texts shall I tell;</p>
<p>I’ll return to the tale that I began.</p>
<p>When Phoebus’ wife had sent for her man,</p>
<p>Anon they wrought their lust to assuage.</p>
<p>The white crow, who hung there in his cage</p>
<p>Beheld the work, but spoke never a word.</p>
<p>But when home was come Phoebus his lord,</p>
<p>The crow sang out: ‘Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!’</p>
<p>What, bird?’ quoth Phoebus, ‘What song sing you?</p>
<p>Were you not wont so merrily to sing</p>
<p>That to my heart it was all rejoicing</p>
<p>To hear your voice? Alas, what song is this?’</p>
<p>‘By God,’ quoth he, I sing naught amiss!</p>
<p>Phoebus, ‘quoth he, ‘for all your worthiness,</p>
<p>For all your beauty and your nobleness,</p>
<p>For all your song and all your minstrelsy,</p>
<p>For all your watching, your eye’s deceived</p>
<p>By a man of little reputation,</p>
<p>One not worth you, in comparison,</p>
<p>Not even worth a gnat, by my life!</p>
<p>For on your bed I saw him have your wife.’</p>
<p>What more do you wish? The crow anon told,</p>
<p>With serious proof and with words bold,</p>
<p>How his wife had indulged in lechery,</p>
<p>Bringing him to great shame and misery,</p>
<p>Said he’d often seen it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Then Phoebus turned away, his thoughts awry,</p>
<p>And felt his sorrowful heart might break in two;</p>
<p>His bow he bent, and set therein an arrow,</p>
<p>And in his anger then his wife did slay –</p>
<p>That was the outcome: there’s no more to say.</p>
<p>For sorrow he broke his tools of minstrelsy,</p>
<p>His harp and lute, gittern and psaltery,</p>
<p>And then he broke his arrows and his bow.</p>
<p>And after that thus spoke he to the crow:</p>
<p>‘Traitor,’ quoth he, ‘with tongue of scorpion,</p>
<p>You have brought me to my confusion!</p>
<p>Alas that I was born! Would I were dead!</p>
<p>O dear wife, O gem of joy now sped,</p>
<p>Who were to me so constant and so true,</p>
<p>Now you lie dead with face pale of hue,</p>
<p>All guiltless – that I dare swear, of this!</p>
<p>O reckless hand, to strike so far amiss!</p>
<p>O troubled mind! O anger heedless,</p>
<p>Thoughtlessly to smite the guiltless!</p>
<p>O mistrust, full of false suspicion!</p>
<p>Where was your reason and discretion?</p>
<p>O, every man, now, beware of rashness!</p>
<p>Believe nothing without strong witness.</p>
<p>Smite not too soon, ere you know why,</p>
<p>And take thought, with a sober eye,</p>
<p>Ere you indulge in execution,</p>
<p>In anger, born of mere suspicion.</p>
<p>Alas, a thousand folk has reckless ire</p>
<p>Destroyed, and hurled them in the mire!</p>
<p>Alas, of sorrow I’ll perish utterly!’</p>
<p>And to the crow: ‘O, false thief!’ said he,</p>
<p>‘I will repay you now for your false tale.</p>
<p>Once you sang like to the nightingale;</p>
<p>Now shall you, false thief, your song forgo,</p>
<p>And all your white feathers, shall lose also,</p>
<p>Never through all your life shall you speak.</p>
<p>Thus shall we on a traitor vengeance wreak!</p>
<p>You and your offspring ever shall be black,</p>
<p>With no sweet sound shall you answer back,</p>
<p>But ever croak, foretelling storm and rain,</p>
<p>As sign that through you my wife was slain.’</p>
<p>And to the crow he went, and that anon,</p>
<p>And pulled out his white feathers every one,</p>
<p>And made him black, and took away his song,</p>
<p>And his speech too, and out of doors he’s gone</p>
<p>To the devil: that he might take him back.</p>
<p>And for this reason so are all crows black.</p>
<p>Lordings, of this example I you pray,</p>
<p>Beware, and be careful what you say:</p>
<p>And never tell a man, thus, on your life,</p>
<p>That another man has been with his wife.</p>
<p>He will hate you mortally, for certain.</p>
<p>King Solomon, as the clerks explain,</p>
<p>Teaches a man to guard his tongue well –</p>
<p>Though as I said, I am not textual –</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thus taught to me, my dame:</p>
<p>‘My son, think of the crow, in God’s name!</p>
<p>My son, keep your counsel and keep your friend.</p>
<p>A wicked tongue is one the fiend doth send;</p>
<p>My son, against the fiend a man may bless!</p>
<p>My son, God, of his eternal goodness,</p>
<p>Walled the tongue too with lips and teeth,</p>
<p>For a man should be careful what he speaks.</p>
<p>My son, full often by a careless speech</p>
<p>Has many a man been ruined, clerks do teach,</p>
<p>But by saying little, and advisedly,</p>
<p>No man is ruined, speaking generally.</p>
<p>My son, your tongue you should restrain</p>
<p>At all times, except when you take pain</p>
<p>To speak of God in honour and prayer.</p>
<p>The first virtue, son, be you aware,</p>
<p>Is to restrain, and guard well your tongue;</p>
<p>So children learn when they are young.</p>
<p>My son, from much speaking, ill-advised,</p>
<p>Where less speech would have sufficed,</p>
<p>Comes much harm: so I was told and taught.</p>
<p>Too much speaking of sin lacks naught.</p>
<p>Know you not how a reckless tongue serves?</p>
<p>As a sword that slashes about and swerves,</p>
<p>Slicing an arm or two, my son, just so</p>
<p>A tongue severs friendship at a blow.</p>
<p>A chatterer is to God abominable.</p>
<p>Read Solomon, the wise and honourable;</p>
<p>Read David in his Psalms; read Seneca.</p>
<p>My son, speak not at all but be a nodder.</p>
<p>Feign to be deaf, if you but chance to hear</p>
<p>A gossip speaking of some dangerous matter.</p>
<p>The Flemings say – and note it if you please –</p>
<p>That lack of gossip is a source of peace.</p>
<p>My son, if you no wicked speech have made,</p>
<p>You need never fear you’ll be betrayed;</p>
<p>And he that speaks ill, I should explain,</p>
<p>He may never recall his words again.</p>
<p>A thing that’s said is said, and forth it goes,</p>
<p>Though regretted, like as not, I’d suppose.  </p>
<p>He is a thrall to one to whom he’s said</p>
<p>Words he now regrets: speak not, instead.</p>
<p>My son: be wary, be not the author new</p>
<p>Of tidings, whether they are false or true.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, among the high or low,</p>
<p>Guard your tongue, and think about the crow.</p>

<p>With that the Manciple his tale ended,</p>
<p>The sun from the meridian descended</p>
<p>So low that he was no more, to my sight,</p>
<p>Than nine and twenty degrees in height.</p>
<p>Four of the clock it was, or so I guess,</p>
<p>For eleven feet or so, no more no less,</p>
<p>My shadow at that moment lay there,</p>
<p>Marking a foot as if my length were</p>
<p>Of six equal feet, in due proportion;</p>
<p>And the sign of Saturn’s exaltation –</p>
<p>I mean Libra – beginning to ascend,</p>
<p>As we were entering a hamlet’s end.</p>
<p>Upon which our Host, as he was pleased</p>
<p>To govern, as now, our jolly company,</p>
<p>Spoke in this wise: ‘Lordings every one,</p>
<p>Now of tales we lack no more than one.</p>
<p>Fulfilled is my pronouncement and decree;</p>
<p>We’ve had a tale from each in their degree.</p>
<p>Almost fulfilled is all my ordinance.</p>
<p>I pray God brings him what of best may chance,</p>
<p>Who tells this last tale entertainingly!</p>
<p>‘Sir priest,’ quoth he, ‘– a vicar now art thee,</p>
<p>Or a parson? The truth now by your faith! –</p>
<p>Whatever you are, spoil you not our play,</p>
<p>For every man save you has told his tale.</p>
<p>Unbuckle now, and show what’s in your bale,</p>
<p>For truly, your face is of such cheer</p>
<p>You con mighty matter it would appear.</p>
<p>Tell us a fable anon, by cock’s bones!’</p>
<p>The Parson then answered him at once:</p>
<p>‘You’ll get no fable that’s told by me.</p>
<p>For Paul, in writing there to Timothy,</p>
<p>Reproves those who swerve from truthfulness,</p>
<p>Relating fables and such sinfulness.</p>
<p>Why should I sow chaff from my fist,</p>
<p>When I can sow wheat, as I would wish?</p>
<p>So I will say, that if you wish to hear</p>
<p>Of morality and virtuous things here,</p>
<p>And grant me of my speech an audience,</p>
<p>I will gladly do Christ full reverence,</p>
<p>Giving you lawful pleasure, as I can.</p>
<p>But in truth I am a southern man;</p>
<p>I cannot give you “rum, ram, ruf” by letter,</p>
<p>And, God knows, I hold rhyme little better.</p>
<p>Rhyme and alliteration I’ll dispose</p>
<p>With, and tell you a merry tale in prose,</p>
<p>To knit up all this game and make an end.</p>
<p>And Jesus, of his grace, may wit me send</p>
<p>To show you the manner, in this passage</p>
<p>Of that perfect glorious pilgrimage</p>
<p>That’s called Jerusalem the celestial.</p>
<p>And if you all agree, anon I shall</p>
<p>Begin my tale, on which now I pray</p>
<p>Give your opinion; I can no better say.</p>
<p>Yet nonetheless, this meditation</p>
<p>I submit it always for correction</p>
<p>By clerics, for I am not textual.</p>
<p>I take but the moral, trust me well.</p>
<p>Therefore I make this protestation</p>
<p>That what I say may stand correction.’</p>
<p>These words of his we all assented to;</p>
<p>For, it seemed to us, fit thing to do</p>
<p>To end with some virtuous sentence,</p>
<p>And to grant him space and audience.</p>
<p>And bade our Host he should then say</p>
<p>That to tell his tale we did him pray.</p>
<p>Our Host spoke the words for us all:</p>
<p>‘Sir priest,’ quoth he, ‘good luck you befall!</p>
<p>Say what you will, and we will gladly hear.’</p>
<p>And with that he added in manner here:</p>
<p>‘Tell us,’ quoth he,’ all your meditation,</p>
<p>But haste you, for the sun’s in declination.</p>
<p>Be fruitful now in a little space,</p>
<p>And to tell it well God send you grace.’</p>
